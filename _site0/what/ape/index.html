<h1 id="1">Buy ApeCoin: Is it worth getting started?&nbsp;Analysis, course &amp; forecast for 2022</h1>
<p>The ApeCoin crypto ICO made history by rising to number 38 in the world following a standing start. With a market capitalization of over $3 billion, ApeCoin already ranks among the top 40 cryptocurrencies worldwide after just a few days of trading.&nbsp;Due to these accolades, many investors are unsure whether they should invest in ApeCoin at this time.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, the following analysis includes a forecast for ApeCoin, as well as a more detailed explanation of the tokenomics and the current rating.</p>
<p>It is also explained as to why this new cryptocurrency is achieving such a unique marketing success. The value of ApeCoin is considered as well.</p>
<h2 id="2">What is ApeCoin?</h2>
<p>There is a new 2022 cryptocurrency called ApeCoin that has its origins in the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most popular and valuable collections of non-fungible tokens in the world. </p>
<p>In addition to Justin Bieber, Eminem, Steve Aoki, Jimmy Fallon, and others, the industry has already attracted a number of celebrities, contributing to the increase in prices. Before ApeCoin, private investors seeking to invest in this NFT faced enormous financial hurdles, which have now been significantly lowered.</p>
<p>One of the most spectacular "crypto IPOs" in history took place on March 17, 2022 with the long-awaited ApeCoin ICO. The ApeCoin price soared to tenbagger levels on the first day, increasing by tenfold. In addition, APE has been able to break into the top 40 cryptocurrencies globally with a market capitalization of more than three billion US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="3">Buy ApeCoin &ndash; the most important things in brief</h2>
<ul>
<li>ApeCoin had a&nbsp;<strong>remarkable start in the crypto market and was able to surpass many previous ICOs.</strong></li>
<li>ApeCoin is based on the&nbsp;Bored Ape NFTs&nbsp;, one of the most expensive and successful NFT collections in the world.</li>
<li>ApeCoin forecasts are&nbsp;mostly positive&nbsp;, even if a lot of fundamental data is still missing.</li>
<li>One possible strategy is to buy a small position of ApeCoin now and then add more tranches.</li>
<li>ApeCoin is already one of the&nbsp;top 40&nbsp;cryptocurrencies worldwide in terms of market capitalization .</li>
<li>ApeCoin is a&nbsp;high-risk investment.&nbsp;A complete loss of value is possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4">How does ApeCoin work?</h3>
<p>ApeCoin operates according to a governance model, which means that the more shares you own in ApeCoin, the more you have the right to vote on future decisions related to APE. In view of the short history of ApeCoin, there are currently few examples of its application, however it is certain that the first votes relating to its strategic orientation will take place in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, ApeCoin currently offers only a limited number of specific features. Especially at the beginning, speculation plays an important role, but in the future concrete functions and use cases will take precedence. ApeCoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;It is also used to create many other cryptocurrencies within the ERC-20 framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to note that a significant portion of the tokens issued during the ICO were awarded to the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project. NFT owners received approximately 10,000 APE tokens - at today's exchange rate of approximately 13 US dollars, this is equivalent to approximately 130,000 US dollars - roughly half of what a Bored Ape NFT costs today.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/ape/ape-opensea.webp" alt="nft market" width="620" height="203" loading="lazy" /></p>
<h3 id="5">What makes ApeCoin special?</h3>
<p>The association between ApeCoin and the highly respected Bored Ape Yacht Club emphasizes the uniqueness of the coin. Additionally, ApeCoin, which is also believed to be capable of having an impact on this exclusive group of users, which has an exceptionally strong purchasing power, can also be affected by this group of users.</p>
<p>However, the current ApeCoin rating should only be a starting point. ApeCoin currently has limited use cases, but the cryptocurrency will be coupled with an entire ecosystem in the future.&nbsp;A future version of ApeCoin will be able to be used for Metaverse games, NFT collections, as a currency or as a governance token for the ApeCoin DAO.</p>
<p>During the last few days, ApeCoin has already demonstrated its uniqueness. Rarely in the past has any cryptocurrency achieved a market capitalization of 3.7 billion US dollars right away - which is indicative of what the ApeCoin course is expected to achieve in the future.</p>
<h3 id="6">The development of ApeCoin</h3>
<p>Although ApeCoin is only available since March 17, 2022, it has been dominating headlines since its introduction. After the coin was listed with providers, many investors also desired to purchase ApeCoin directly, resulting in an enormous price increase on the first day from around 1 US dollar to almost 40 US dollars.</p>
<p>It was only a brief peak in ApeCoin's price, since the cryptocurrency immediately changed hands again at a price of around six US dollars on the same day. However, the following day, ApeCoin began an upward trend that continues to this day.</p>
<h3 id="7">ApeCoin forecast: does APE have potential?</h3>
<p>With new crypto currencies, crypto forecasting is much more challenging than with established coins.&nbsp;Yet, there are many ways to determine a specific ApeCoin price forecast based on fundamental data, technical analysis and analyst calculations.</p>

<h4 id="8">Basic ApeCoin forecast</h4>
<p>There are several ways to view ApeCoin's fundamental forecast. Those who support ApeCoin will cite its large (future) ecosystem as one of the reasons to purchase it.&nbsp;Additionally, many other functions related to ApeCoin will follow in the future, which is why ApeCoin forecasts for the current Ethereum price are already available on the Internet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, critics also assert that ApeCoin has only served as a speculative object for other investors rather than making previous owners of Bored Ape NFTs rich. For the time being, the basic ApeCoin forecast lacks critical functionalities that would enable it to recognize a clear benefit. The ApeCoin course is largely imagined as being based on the fact that these functions will emerge in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that pros and cons clearly alternate here, the ApeCoin forecast based on fundamental data is neutral.</p>
<h4 id="9">Technical ApeCoin forecast</h4>
<p>The chart shows only a few starting points due to the short history of ApeCoin. Although only six days old, a relatively stable upward trend was established in the first few hours, after the ICO and the capers in the price. However, it speaks for a positive ApeCoin prognosis that the price of ApeCoin could continue to rise even after the ICO ended.&nbsp;Hence, the cryptocurrency also served as a deterrent against a possible ApeCoin scam.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="10">Analyst calculations</h4>
<p>An analyst's calculations, which are based on artificial intelligence, algorithms, and expert opinions, can also be used for a more detailed forecast of ApeCoin. Also here, opinions are divided, but tend to go in a positive direction.</p>
<p>While one of the calculations only sees the ApeCoin price in a year-long sideways movement between USD 10 and 12, another analyst for the ApeCoin forecast sees a&nbsp;slow but steady upward trend&nbsp;, the ApeCoin 2025 up to 25 US dollars and by 2030 even to 59 US dollars.</p>
<p>According to another ApeCoin forecast, price could reach USD 60 by 2025, USD 100 by 2027, and USD 580 by 2031, which is a return of more than 4000%. The price of ApeCoin is based on the current rate.</p>

<h4 id="11">Which ApeCoin wallet do you need?</h4>
<p>Is it worthwhile to purchase ApeCoin based on this partly optimistic price forecast? Consequently, if you answer this question with a yes, you will also need a corresponding wallet. The popular hardware wallets have not yet followed the Bitcoin exchanges, which listed the new ApeCoin cryptocurrency immediately.</p>
<p>ApeCoin is currently most commonly stored in online wallets, for this reason. Although there are some significant risks, you can benefit not only from the sophisticated security mechanisms of the established providers, but also from the possibility of buying and selling ApeCoin quickly. As a result, you can react to the high volatility and strong fluctuation in the price of ApeCoin extremely effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to Trust Wallet or MetaMask can be downloaded if you prefer an independent mobile wallet to use with ApeCoin.</strong>&nbsp;The responsibility for storing the coins lies with you, so you should be attentive to backups and backup keys.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="12">When is the best time to buy ApeCoin?</h4>
<p>The principle generally applies that if one desires to invest in a particular cryptocurrency in the long run, one should do so sooner rather than later due to the consistently positive performance of cryptocurrencies in the long run.</p>
<p>In the case of ApeCoin, this is only partially true.&nbsp;It is certain that ApeCoin will only continue to rise in the future, unfolding its full potential so that the current ApeCoin price will not be reached again in the future. Because of the current hype, the large price fluctuations, and the unclear functionalities of ApeCoin, it is more likely that the coin will test the USD 10 level again and fall below it.</p>
<p>In the event that you do not wish to miss the entry, you can still purchase a first tranche of ApeCoin in order to position yourself and then await further developments. In this case, more significant price setbacks in the single-digit range may be used to make additional purchases.</p>
<h4 id="13">The best ApeCoin alternatives</h4>
<p>However, it is always worthwhile to look around for other options before making any investment. There are also&nbsp;numerous ApeCoin alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those who see great potential in the NFT area in particular may want to consider more established NFT and Metaverse coins, such as Decentraland , Axie Infinity or The Sandbox instead of ApeCoin . Crypto forecasts for the future are very promising for some of these.</li>
<li>There are a number of established cryptocurrencies outside of the NFT market that are showing strong growth potential. These include Solana, Luna, and Avalanche.</li>

<h4>Is Apecoin a good investment</h4>
<p>Is Apecoin a good investment, Despite their extreme pain, bear markets often provide investors with meaningful investment opportunities. There is perhaps no better example of a sensible investment opportunity than the ApeCoin (APE), the token of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).&nbsp;A token based on the NFT model was launched by Yuga Labs in March, quickly becoming one of the largest cryptocurrencies related to NFTs in the world.</p>
<p>Over the last two months, ApeCoin has suffered a shocking 90 percent decline (from its all-time high).&nbsp;Otherside, Yuga Labs' largest project to date, has greatly influenced the development of the token.&nbsp;Users can use their NFTs as avatars in this extensive metaverse role-playing game.&nbsp;The APE token provides the backbone of Otherside and serves as both a currency and a governance token.</p>
<p>There are favorable conditions for the Otherside game and the APE.&nbsp;To make this a reality, Yuga is working closely with Animoca brands, the current king of the metaverse.&nbsp;In addition to the strong duo behind the token, it has more potential than nearly any other alternative currency due to its artificially depressed price.</p>
<h4><strong>What will Apecoin be worth?&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>ApeCoin may be a particularly attractive investment option for long-term investors with a strong belief in the success of Yuga Labs and the Metaverse genre in general.&nbsp;APE's preliminary reserve price is difficult to predict.&nbsp;It is possible that soil formation has already been completed.&nbsp;There is a possibility that APE will continue to fall for a few more months before it begins to rise again.&nbsp;There has been a significant amount of volatility in the APE market, making it even more difficult to predict the future direction of the market.</p>
<p>There have been highs of about $27.50 and lows of about $3.20 in the few months this stock has been trading.&nbsp;The metaverse trend continues to flourish, and Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands are developing a great metaverse game, it is difficult to believe that APE will not reach new all-time highs in the future.&nbsp;In the long run, if both of these conditions hold true, then APE could turn out to be the most profitable altcoin investment of the year.</p>
<h4><strong>Will ApeCoin rise?</strong></h4>
<p>Will ApeCoin rise? In the near future, ApeCoin may be able to reach its all-time high, but this will not be so easy as it is with many other altcoins.&nbsp;It would appear that the high of approximately $27.50 (depending on the stock market) is not entirely natural.&nbsp;Due to the imprint Otherside of the NFT, the price was greatly inflated.&nbsp;Rather than using Ethereum to handle the expensive sale, Yuga Labs chose to use ApeCoin.&nbsp;Due to a large amount of APE being purchased to participate in the sale, the price of the APE increased significantly.</p>
<p>In addition, the sale resulted in an artificial drop in price following the conclusion of the sale.&nbsp;There were many prospects who had already purchased APEs but did not have sufficient funds to pay the high transaction fees (more than $6,000, not including the cost of the coin).&nbsp;There were many who were unable to do anything else with the token. Therefore, they decided to sell it for whatever price they could find, causing the price to significantly decline.&nbsp;Yuga Labs has carefully planned the future of the token in order to ensure its success.&nbsp;Choosing to sell in ApeCoin rather than in Ethereum seemed to be a completely irrational decision.</p>
<p>The total number of Otherside NFTs sold by Yuga was approximately 55,000. Yuga demanded 305 APE per NFT in public sales.&nbsp;Miners who possessed a Bored Ape or a Mutant Ape were able to receive their APE through the free airdrop.&nbsp;In the days leading up to the sale, most people bought them on the open market for more than $20.&nbsp;For a price of $20, the cost of each NFT would be more than $6,000, more than two Ethereum at the time.&nbsp;Approximately 75 million ApeCoins were generated through the sale.&nbsp;Instead of charging 1 ETH per NFT, the company could charge 2 ETH instead.&nbsp;The decision only makes sense if comprehensive plans have already been developed for the future support of APE.&nbsp;APE will likely be much more than merely a governance token, though it is difficult to determine what exactly that means.</p>
<h4><strong>Does Apecoin have potential in the long run?</strong></h4>
<p>ApeCoin is clearly not as secure an investment over the long term as Ethereum and Bitcoin, which are more established cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;Even so, its relatively small size makes it more likely to become a "moonshot."&nbsp;It is likely that ApeCoin is a valuable investment for the long term in the metaverse.&nbsp;The company has several significant advantages over its competitors.&nbsp;Yuga Labs is one of the largest start-up companies in the field of NFTs and Metaverse.&nbsp;APE appears to be very committed to helping Otherside succeed, and it appears to have the resources to do so.</p>

Buy ApeCoin: Is it worth getting started?&amp;nbsp;Analysis, course &amp;amp; forecast for 2022
The ApeCoin crypto ICO made history by rising to number 38 in the world following a standing start. With a market capitalization of over $3 billion, ApeCoin already ranks among the top 40 cryptocurrencies worldwide after just a few days of trading.&amp;nbsp;Due to these accolades, many investors are unsure whether they should invest in ApeCoin at this time.
In order to answer this question, the following analysis includes a forecast for ApeCoin, as well as a more detailed explanation of the tokenomics and the current rating.
It is also explained as to why this new cryptocurrency is achieving such a unique marketing success. The value of ApeCoin is considered as well.
What is ApeCoin?
There is a new 2022 cryptocurrency called ApeCoin that has its origins in the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most popular and valuable collections of non-fungible tokens in the world. 
In addition to Justin Bieber, Eminem, Steve Aoki, Jimmy Fallon, and others, the industry has already attracted a number of celebrities, contributing to the increase in prices. Before ApeCoin, private investors seeking to invest in this NFT faced enormous financial hurdles, which have now been significantly lowered.
One of the most spectacular &quot;crypto IPOs&quot; in history took place on March 17, 2022 with the long-awaited ApeCoin ICO. The ApeCoin price soared to tenbagger levels on the first day, increasing by tenfold. In addition, APE has been able to break into the top 40 cryptocurrencies globally with a market capitalization of more than three billion US dollars.

Buy ApeCoin &amp;ndash; the most important things in brief

ApeCoin had a&amp;nbsp;remarkable start in the crypto market and was able to surpass many previous ICOs.
ApeCoin is based on the&amp;nbsp;Bored Ape NFTs&amp;nbsp;, one of the most expensive and successful NFT collections in the world.
ApeCoin forecasts are&amp;nbsp;mostly positive&amp;nbsp;, even if a lot of fundamental data is still missing.
One possible strategy is to buy a small position of ApeCoin now and then add more tranches.
ApeCoin is already one of the&amp;nbsp;top 40&amp;nbsp;cryptocurrencies worldwide in terms of market capitalization .
ApeCoin is a&amp;nbsp;high-risk investment.&amp;nbsp;A complete loss of value is possible.

How does ApeCoin work?
ApeCoin operates according to a governance model, which means that the more shares you own in ApeCoin, the more you have the right to vote on future decisions related to APE. In view of the short history of ApeCoin, there are currently few examples of its application, however it is certain that the first votes relating to its strategic orientation will take place in the future.
Additionally, ApeCoin currently offers only a limited number of specific features. Especially at the beginning, speculation plays an important role, but in the future concrete functions and use cases will take precedence. ApeCoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the Ethereum blockchain.&amp;nbsp;It is also used to create many other cryptocurrencies within the ERC-20 framework.&amp;nbsp;
In addition, it is important to note that a significant portion of the tokens issued during the ICO were awarded to the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project. NFT owners received approximately 10,000 APE tokens - at today&apos;s exchange rate of approximately 13 US dollars, this is equivalent to approximately 130,000 US dollars - roughly half of what a Bored Ape NFT costs today.

What makes ApeCoin special?
The association between ApeCoin and the highly respected Bored Ape Yacht Club emphasizes the uniqueness of the coin. Additionally, ApeCoin, which is also believed to be capable of having an impact on this exclusive group of users, which has an exceptionally strong purchasing power, can also be affected by this group of users.
However, the current ApeCoin rating should only be a starting point. ApeCoin currently has limited use cases, but the cryptocurrency will be coupled with an entire ecosystem in the future.&amp;nbsp;A future version of ApeCoin will be able to be used for Metaverse games, NFT collections, as a currency or as a governance token for the ApeCoin DAO.
During the last few days, ApeCoin has already demonstrated its uniqueness. Rarely in the past has any cryptocurrency achieved a market capitalization of 3.7 billion US dollars right away - which is indicative of what the ApeCoin course is expected to achieve in the future.
The development of ApeCoin
Although ApeCoin is only available since March 17, 2022, it has been dominating headlines since its introduction. After the coin was listed with providers, many investors also desired to purchase ApeCoin directly, resulting in an enormous price increase on the first day from around 1 US dollar to almost 40 US dollars.
It was only a brief peak in ApeCoin&apos;s price, since the cryptocurrency immediately changed hands again at a price of around six US dollars on the same day. However, the following day, ApeCoin began an upward trend that continues to this day.
ApeCoin forecast: does APE have potential?
With new crypto currencies, crypto forecasting is much more challenging than with established coins.&amp;nbsp;Yet, there are many ways to determine a specific ApeCoin price forecast based on fundamental data, technical analysis and analyst calculations.



  
  
  
  
  
  
  


Basic ApeCoin forecast
There are several ways to view ApeCoin&apos;s fundamental forecast. Those who support ApeCoin will cite its large (future) ecosystem as one of the reasons to purchase it.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, many other functions related to ApeCoin will follow in the future, which is why ApeCoin forecasts for the current Ethereum price are already available on the Internet.
On the other hand, critics also assert that ApeCoin has only served as a speculative object for other investors rather than making previous owners of Bored Ape NFTs rich. For the time being, the basic ApeCoin forecast lacks critical functionalities that would enable it to recognize a clear benefit. The ApeCoin course is largely imagined as being based on the fact that these functions will emerge in the future.
Due to the fact that pros and cons clearly alternate here, the ApeCoin forecast based on fundamental data is neutral.
Technical ApeCoin forecast
The chart shows only a few starting points due to the short history of ApeCoin. Although only six days old, a relatively stable upward trend was established in the first few hours, after the ICO and the capers in the price. However, it speaks for a positive ApeCoin prognosis that the price of ApeCoin could continue to rise even after the ICO ended.&amp;nbsp;Hence, the cryptocurrency also served as a deterrent against a possible ApeCoin scam.&amp;nbsp;
Analyst calculations
An analyst&apos;s calculations, which are based on artificial intelligence, algorithms, and expert opinions, can also be used for a more detailed forecast of ApeCoin. Also here, opinions are divided, but tend to go in a positive direction.
While one of the calculations only sees the ApeCoin price in a year-long sideways movement between USD 10 and 12, another analyst for the ApeCoin forecast sees a&amp;nbsp;slow but steady upward trend&amp;nbsp;, the ApeCoin 2025 up to 25 US dollars and by 2030 even to 59 US dollars.
According to another ApeCoin forecast, price could reach USD 60 by 2025, USD 100 by 2027, and USD 580 by 2031, which is a return of more than 4000%. The price of ApeCoin is based on the current rate.

Which ApeCoin wallet do you need?
Is it worthwhile to purchase ApeCoin based on this partly optimistic price forecast? Consequently, if you answer this question with a yes, you will also need a corresponding wallet. The popular hardware wallets have not yet followed the Bitcoin exchanges, which listed the new ApeCoin cryptocurrency immediately.
ApeCoin is currently most commonly stored in online wallets, for this reason. Although there are some significant risks, you can benefit not only from the sophisticated security mechanisms of the established providers, but also from the possibility of buying and selling ApeCoin quickly. As a result, you can react to the high volatility and strong fluctuation in the price of ApeCoin extremely effectively.&amp;nbsp;
Alternatives to Trust Wallet or MetaMask can be downloaded if you prefer an independent mobile wallet to use with ApeCoin.&amp;nbsp;The responsibility for storing the coins lies with you, so you should be attentive to backups and backup keys.&amp;nbsp;

When is the best time to buy ApeCoin?
The principle generally applies that if one desires to invest in a particular cryptocurrency in the long run, one should do so sooner rather than later due to the consistently positive performance of cryptocurrencies in the long run.
In the case of ApeCoin, this is only partially true.&amp;nbsp;It is certain that ApeCoin will only continue to rise in the future, unfolding its full potential so that the current ApeCoin price will not be reached again in the future. Because of the current hype, the large price fluctuations, and the unclear functionalities of ApeCoin, it is more likely that the coin will test the USD 10 level again and fall below it.
In the event that you do not wish to miss the entry, you can still purchase a first tranche of ApeCoin in order to position yourself and then await further developments. In this case, more significant price setbacks in the single-digit range may be used to make additional purchases.
The best ApeCoin alternatives
However, it is always worthwhile to look around for other options before making any investment. There are also&amp;nbsp;numerous ApeCoin alternatives:

Those who see great potential in the NFT area in particular may want to consider more established NFT and Metaverse coins, such as Decentraland , Axie Infinity or The Sandbox instead of ApeCoin . Crypto forecasts for the future are very promising for some of these.
There are a number of established cryptocurrencies outside of the NFT market that are showing strong growth potential. These include Solana, Luna, and Avalanche.

Is Apecoin a good investment
Is Apecoin a good investment, Despite their extreme pain, bear markets often provide investors with meaningful investment opportunities. There is perhaps no better example of a sensible investment opportunity than the ApeCoin (APE), the token of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).&amp;nbsp;A token based on the NFT model was launched by Yuga Labs in March, quickly becoming one of the largest cryptocurrencies related to NFTs in the world.
Over the last two months, ApeCoin has suffered a shocking 90 percent decline (from its all-time high).&amp;nbsp;Otherside, Yuga Labs&apos; largest project to date, has greatly influenced the development of the token.&amp;nbsp;Users can use their NFTs as avatars in this extensive metaverse role-playing game.&amp;nbsp;The APE token provides the backbone of Otherside and serves as both a currency and a governance token.
There are favorable conditions for the Otherside game and the APE.&amp;nbsp;To make this a reality, Yuga is working closely with Animoca brands, the current king of the metaverse.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the strong duo behind the token, it has more potential than nearly any other alternative currency due to its artificially depressed price.
What will Apecoin be worth?&amp;nbsp;
ApeCoin may be a particularly attractive investment option for long-term investors with a strong belief in the success of Yuga Labs and the Metaverse genre in general.&amp;nbsp;APE&apos;s preliminary reserve price is difficult to predict.&amp;nbsp;It is possible that soil formation has already been completed.&amp;nbsp;There is a possibility that APE will continue to fall for a few more months before it begins to rise again.&amp;nbsp;There has been a significant amount of volatility in the APE market, making it even more difficult to predict the future direction of the market.
There have been highs of about $27.50 and lows of about $3.20 in the few months this stock has been trading.&amp;nbsp;The metaverse trend continues to flourish, and Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands are developing a great metaverse game, it is difficult to believe that APE will not reach new all-time highs in the future.&amp;nbsp;In the long run, if both of these conditions hold true, then APE could turn out to be the most profitable altcoin investment of the year.
Will ApeCoin rise?
Will ApeCoin rise? In the near future, ApeCoin may be able to reach its all-time high, but this will not be so easy as it is with many other altcoins.&amp;nbsp;It would appear that the high of approximately $27.50 (depending on the stock market) is not entirely natural.&amp;nbsp;Due to the imprint Otherside of the NFT, the price was greatly inflated.&amp;nbsp;Rather than using Ethereum to handle the expensive sale, Yuga Labs chose to use ApeCoin.&amp;nbsp;Due to a large amount of APE being purchased to participate in the sale, the price of the APE increased significantly.
In addition, the sale resulted in an artificial drop in price following the conclusion of the sale.&amp;nbsp;There were many prospects who had already purchased APEs but did not have sufficient funds to pay the high transaction fees (more than $6,000, not including the cost of the coin).&amp;nbsp;There were many who were unable to do anything else with the token. Therefore, they decided to sell it for whatever price they could find, causing the price to significantly decline.&amp;nbsp;Yuga Labs has carefully planned the future of the token in order to ensure its success.&amp;nbsp;Choosing to sell in ApeCoin rather than in Ethereum seemed to be a completely irrational decision.
The total number of Otherside NFTs sold by Yuga was approximately 55,000. Yuga demanded 305 APE per NFT in public sales.&amp;nbsp;Miners who possessed a Bored Ape or a Mutant Ape were able to receive their APE through the free airdrop.&amp;nbsp;In the days leading up to the sale, most people bought them on the open market for more than $20.&amp;nbsp;For a price of $20, the cost of each NFT would be more than $6,000, more than two Ethereum at the time.&amp;nbsp;Approximately 75 million ApeCoins were generated through the sale.&amp;nbsp;Instead of charging 1 ETH per NFT, the company could charge 2 ETH instead.&amp;nbsp;The decision only makes sense if comprehensive plans have already been developed for the future support of APE.&amp;nbsp;APE will likely be much more than merely a governance token, though it is difficult to determine what exactly that means.
Does Apecoin have potential in the long run?
ApeCoin is clearly not as secure an investment over the long term as Ethereum and Bitcoin, which are more established cryptocurrencies.&amp;nbsp;Even so, its relatively small size makes it more likely to become a &quot;moonshot.&quot;&amp;nbsp;It is likely that ApeCoin is a valuable investment for the long term in the metaverse.&amp;nbsp;The company has several significant advantages over its competitors.&amp;nbsp;Yuga Labs is one of the largest start-up companies in the field of NFTs and Metaverse.&amp;nbsp;APE appears to be very committed to helping Otherside succeed, and it appears to have the resources to do so.
