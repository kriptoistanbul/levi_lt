<h1 id="1">Buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or not?&nbsp;Instructions 2022</h1>
<p>Those who wish to invest in what is probably the most well-known cryptocurrency do so at their own risk. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are now the two most famous Bitcoins.&nbsp;This article describes how cryptocurrency enthusiasts can purchase Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>Our article explains how Bitcoin Cash came about and where the differences lie between it and Bitcoin. Let us take a closer look at the price development and look at the options available for purchasing Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>We conclude by explaining how to buy Bitcoin Cash in detail.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/bch/bch-future.webp" alt="bch prices potential" width="620" height="620" loading="lazy" /></p>
<h2 id="2">What is Bitcoin Cash?</h2>
<p>As a hard fork of the original Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created on August 1st, 2017 and differs from Bitcoin only in a few important details. Due to the well-known problems with Bitcoin (poor scalability, problems with SegWit), part of the Bitcoin network has decided to launch its own alternative coin to deal with these problems.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, BCH is now an independent altcoin known as Bitcoin Cash, Bcash, or simply BCH as a result of a major dispute between Bitcoin developers.</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash has several advantages due to its relationship with Bitcoin. The code is largely based on the same properties and the blockchain is also structured similarly, so companies or manufacturers who are already familiar with Bitcoin should find Bitcoin Cash extremely easy to implement. As a consequence, Bitcoin is also supported by a large selection of providers and crypto exchanges.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the whole, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) offers all of the functionality associated with Bitcoin. However, it also offers some advantages as a result of the changes, including significantly reduced transaction fees for .B.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the continuous price increase of Bitcoin Cash, it is clear that the crypto community has a great deal of interest in the coin, and the number of users continues to rise.&nbsp;As a result, there is hope that this digital currency will gain in value and importance in the future.</p>
<h2 id="3">How does Bitcoin Cash work and what technology is behind it?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Cash operates on the same principles as Bitcoin. In other words, the coin is based on a peer-to-peer network that connects many nodes together.&nbsp;In order to ensure the security of transactions, they invest their computing power in mining new coins at the same time. The mining process is very familiar from Bitcoins and other crypto currencies, and it does not differ here.</p>
<p>Similarly to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash uses the so-called SegWit method, which allows more transactions per block and more rapid transaction processing by eliminating the need to store the same information multiple times.</p>
<p>Initial Bitcoin development was intended for use as a means of payment and not as an investment vehicle. The cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin were seen as part of the digital revolution that would be used in everyday life to pay for things such as coffee across the street or noodles in the supermarket. Despite this, Bitcoin itself is far from this, due to its extreme fluctuations in value and speculation on ever-increasing prices.</p>
<p>In contrast, Bitcoin Cash is closer to this version: its transaction fees are significantly lower because of the larger block size. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is limited to about 1000 transactions per block.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash, as a result of its high capacity, charges a lower fee than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a cost of less than one cent, which is far lower than the price of Bitcoin in 2021, when you may pay around 10 to 20 euro for a transaction.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, Bitcoin Cash implements the original version of the digital currency and is aiming to revolutionize the payment industry.&nbsp;Perhaps in a few years, we will all be able to make payment at our favorite cafe via cheap, practical, and fast Bitcoin Cash transactions.</p>
<h3 id="4">Should you invest in Bitcoin Cash?</h3>
<p>The long-term viability of cryptocurrencies is not yet certain. Before investing in cryptocurrencies, traders should be aware that there is no guarantee of profits in the future.&nbsp;There are always unexpected developments in the crypto market.</p>
<p>When investing in crypto currencies, you have a specific objective in mind. There are more than 4,000 digital currencies available today, and not all of them serve the same purposes.&nbsp;Bitcoin Cash is generally invested in due to the possibility of an increase in its value in the future. As of October 2016, Bitcoin Cash ranked third among all cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, this does not guarantee the future of the coin.</p>
<p>The only amounts that should be invested are those that are not needed in the medium and long term. Investing in Bitcoin Cash may be a suitable choice for those who can accept a high degree of risk while simultaneously hoping for high returns. In general, there is the possibility of significant price increases.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Cash course develops independently, even if Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are frequently mentioned together.&nbsp;Thus, the success of this digital currency is not inextricably linked to the success of other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a possibility that Bitcoin Cash could become an accepted and practical payment method in the online world. Due to the advantages of its own protocol, Bitcoin Cash could catch up with Bitcoin in terms of payment volume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5">The Bitcoin Cash price development</h3>
<p>In the years from 2020 to 2021, Bitcoin Cash's price experienced a dramatic increase and was even quoted at times at over 1500 dollars in May of that year. In spite of this, Bitcoin Cash has not been able to return to its previous all-time high, which it already reached on December 20, 2017 at a level of USD 4,355.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can continue to be ranked among the top 25 cryptocurrencies and has not completely lost relevance. Additionally, it has been able to attract some exciting new partners, which suggests that the cryptocurrency may receive a new boost later in 2022. It remains an exciting time for the cryptocurrency.</p>

<h3 id="6">Previous Bitcoin Cash price development in 2022</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash, have been in a bear market since the last high in May 2021. In 2022, the price will continue its downward trend, falling from &euro; 397.47 to &euro; 282.73 and thus by 28.79%. BCH can only hold on to 23rd place among the largest crypto currencies by market capitalization.</p>
<h3 id="7">Bitcoin Cash Forecast 2023 to 2025</h3>
<p>Further performance will certainly be determined by the performance of the crypto market, but the forecast for 2023 and the future is encouraging. First and foremost, however, a forecast over several years is always extremely speculative in the world of crypto currencies. It is possible for a great deal to happen in three years, but we believe that Bitcoin Cash is in a relatively good position for the future. At the same time, there have been many interesting developments regarding Bitcoin Cash recently, and efforts are being made to further enhance its advantages.&nbsp;Given the general crypto boom and the increased transactions, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin Cash can deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>In general, a great deal depends on whether BCH is able to retain and expand its competitive advantage , or whether it falls behind other cryptocurrencies. Currently, we are in an exciting phase for this decision, which could make Bitcoin Cash very interesting to invest in.</p>
<p>Here is a brief perspective on the views of different sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Smarteum website, Bitcoin Cash is likely to have a very bright future as a whole. According to their estimates, the coin will be worth approximately 10,000 US dollars in five years. Furthermore, you do not believe in a miracle, but you also emphasize the high volatility of the coin as well as the importance of whether Bitcoin Cash is able to engage with its competitors effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Digitalcoinprice believes in a less strong bull market: they believe the price will rise until 2023, peaking around $2500, which would represent a gain of over 300% over current prices.</strong>&nbsp;In addition, Digitalcoinprice emphasizes that forecasts for crypto currencies, including BCH, are very difficult, and should not be regarded as definitive.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8">Bitcoin cash mining</h4>
<p>In part, mining Bitcoin Cash can be performed using the same devices as Bitcoin mining. The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, however, is continuously increasing due to the increasing number of coins mined. Consequently, mining Bitcoin Cash becomes more and more attractive compared to mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bitcoin Cash's developers have further reduced the difficulty of mining their coin, hoping to attract the attention of the mining community. In the event that this project is successful, a lot of computing power will be available to Bitcoin Cash and its price, as well as the general demand for the coin, will be increased.</p>
<h4 id="9">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?</h4>
<p>In spite of the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are based on nearly the same substructure of the Bitcoin blockchain, they remain entirely independent of each other.&nbsp;As a result of a fork of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash was created when a large number of developers refused to accept the shortcomings of the protocol, and created their own platform.</p>
<h4 id="10">So why do we need Bitcoin Cash?</h4>
<p>By introducing Bitcoin Cash, there are some adjustments to Bitcoin that solve some of the known problems: due to its great popularity and low transaction capacity, Bitcoin payments have become expensive.&nbsp;The fees are as high as 20 euros in some instances. Due to the large block size, Bitcoin Cash has a major advantage here, as it requires a transaction fee of less than 0.01 Euro per transaction.</p>

<h4 id="13">What happens after the Bitcoin Cash purchase?</h4>
<p>As soon as possible after purchasing Bitcoin Cash, you should store it securely. As a next step, you can decide whether to resell the coins one day, and at what price. The most profitable option should be obvious. You will need a wallet if you wish to keep the coins in your possession throughout this period.</p>
<h4>Bitcoin cash storage</h4>
<p>Immediately following the purchase of Bitcoin Cash, the coins should be moved into a wallet, a digital wallet, as soon as possible. In the case of opening an account with a crypto exchange, you will also be provided with a wallet. The wallet is usually credited automatically.</p>
<p>This coupling has the disadvantage that the exchange operators have access to the wallet and therefore control it. Your wallet is also at risk if the exchange is hacked. Alternatively, you can use an external wallet service. Be sure to pay attention to seriousness here!</p>

<h4>Bitcoin cash sale</h4>
<p>It is essentially the same as buying Bitcoin Cash, except that you are selling it.&nbsp;In the ideal scenario, you should use the same platform for both the purchase and the sale.</p>
<h5 id="14">Bitcoin Cash Pros and Cons</h5>
<p>Bitcoin Cash /BCH) offers, especially compared to Bitcoin (BTC), some advantages but also some disadvantages.&nbsp;Which exactly these are, and how they affect the function and performance, we clarify in the following.</p>
<p>Advantage</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size than Bitcoin.&nbsp;This makes it possible to execute many&nbsp;more transactions per second&nbsp;.</li>
<li>In addition, this leads to significantly&nbsp;lower transaction fees&nbsp;.&nbsp;While with Bitcoin you sometimes pay over 20 &euro; for a transaction, with Bitcoin Cash less than 0.01 Euro per transaction are due.</li>
<li>Another advantage of Bitcoin Cash is its great&nbsp;similarity to Bitcoin.&nbsp;This allows easy integration of the Bitcoin Cash platform into applications that already support Bitcoin.&nbsp;Hence the great support for the currency BCH.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Cash is significantly&nbsp;less popular than Bitcoin&nbsp;.&nbsp;Although the currency is in the top 20 most popular cryptocurrencies, it is still in the shadow of Bitcoin.</li>
<li>This has an impact on&nbsp;price developments&nbsp;, where we notice that the price of Bitcoin has recently risen more than twice as fast as that of Bitcoin Cash.</li>
<li>The advantages of Bitcoin Cash may also be negated by the evolution of Bitcoin. If features are introduced to the Bitcoin protocol that dramatically speed up and reduce the cost of transactions, Bitcoin Cash might lose its competitive advantage.</li>

             <p itemprop="text" class="faq-a">There are approximately 4,000 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash. On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin Cash was created from Bitcoin. The principal difference between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is the speed at which it can be mined. It is expected that Bitcoin Cash will become a widely used and widely recognized payment system in the long run.</p>

        <div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
             <p itemprop="text" class="faq-a">Cryptocurrency trading is only as secure as the trading platform on which it takes place. Investing in a shady exchange or setting up your coins on a dubious platform will result in the trade being completed before it has even begun, with the fraudsters taking your money. Thus, the choice of a platform should be based on its security, authenticity, and transparency. Otherwise, you will not be adequately protected. Thus, you would be wise to keep an eye out for crypto trading platforms that are licensed, read reviews and testimonials, and carefully examine each provider.</p>

             <p itemprop="text" class="faq-a">The basic idea of ​​cryptocurrencies is anonymity.&nbsp;That's why crypto fans can of course purchase Bitcoin Cash anonymously.&nbsp;To purchase, you do not have to provide your address or any other data, only when opening an account.&nbsp;Your data is therefore stored with the crypto exchanges or your broker.&nbsp;These can be viewed by the authorities in case of doubt.&nbsp;So the matter is not completely anonymous.&nbsp;One way to acquire Bitcoin Cash anonymously is through mining!</p>

Buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or not?&amp;nbsp;Instructions 2022
Those who wish to invest in what is probably the most well-known cryptocurrency do so at their own risk. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are now the two most famous Bitcoins.&amp;nbsp;This article describes how cryptocurrency enthusiasts can purchase Bitcoin Cash.
Our article explains how Bitcoin Cash came about and where the differences lie between it and Bitcoin. Let us take a closer look at the price development and look at the options available for purchasing Bitcoin Cash.
We conclude by explaining how to buy Bitcoin Cash in detail.

What is Bitcoin Cash?
As a hard fork of the original Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created on August 1st, 2017 and differs from Bitcoin only in a few important details. Due to the well-known problems with Bitcoin (poor scalability, problems with SegWit), part of the Bitcoin network has decided to launch its own alternative coin to deal with these problems.
Therefore, BCH is now an independent altcoin known as Bitcoin Cash, Bcash, or simply BCH as a result of a major dispute between Bitcoin developers.
Bitcoin Cash has several advantages due to its relationship with Bitcoin. The code is largely based on the same properties and the blockchain is also structured similarly, so companies or manufacturers who are already familiar with Bitcoin should find Bitcoin Cash extremely easy to implement. As a consequence, Bitcoin is also supported by a large selection of providers and crypto exchanges.

On the whole, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) offers all of the functionality associated with Bitcoin. However, it also offers some advantages as a result of the changes, including significantly reduced transaction fees for .B.

With the continuous price increase of Bitcoin Cash, it is clear that the crypto community has a great deal of interest in the coin, and the number of users continues to rise.&amp;nbsp;As a result, there is hope that this digital currency will gain in value and importance in the future.
How does Bitcoin Cash work and what technology is behind it?
Bitcoin Cash operates on the same principles as Bitcoin. In other words, the coin is based on a peer-to-peer network that connects many nodes together.&amp;nbsp;In order to ensure the security of transactions, they invest their computing power in mining new coins at the same time. The mining process is very familiar from Bitcoins and other crypto currencies, and it does not differ here.
Similarly to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash uses the so-called SegWit method, which allows more transactions per block and more rapid transaction processing by eliminating the need to store the same information multiple times.
Initial Bitcoin development was intended for use as a means of payment and not as an investment vehicle. The cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin were seen as part of the digital revolution that would be used in everyday life to pay for things such as coffee across the street or noodles in the supermarket. Despite this, Bitcoin itself is far from this, due to its extreme fluctuations in value and speculation on ever-increasing prices.
In contrast, Bitcoin Cash is closer to this version: its transaction fees are significantly lower because of the larger block size. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is limited to about 1000 transactions per block.
Bitcoin Cash, as a result of its high capacity, charges a lower fee than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a cost of less than one cent, which is far lower than the price of Bitcoin in 2021, when you may pay around 10 to 20 euro for a transaction.
As its name suggests, Bitcoin Cash implements the original version of the digital currency and is aiming to revolutionize the payment industry.&amp;nbsp;Perhaps in a few years, we will all be able to make payment at our favorite cafe via cheap, practical, and fast Bitcoin Cash transactions.
Should you invest in Bitcoin Cash?
The long-term viability of cryptocurrencies is not yet certain. Before investing in cryptocurrencies, traders should be aware that there is no guarantee of profits in the future.&amp;nbsp;There are always unexpected developments in the crypto market.
When investing in crypto currencies, you have a specific objective in mind. There are more than 4,000 digital currencies available today, and not all of them serve the same purposes.&amp;nbsp;Bitcoin Cash is generally invested in due to the possibility of an increase in its value in the future. As of October 2016, Bitcoin Cash ranked third among all cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, this does not guarantee the future of the coin.
The only amounts that should be invested are those that are not needed in the medium and long term. Investing in Bitcoin Cash may be a suitable choice for those who can accept a high degree of risk while simultaneously hoping for high returns. In general, there is the possibility of significant price increases.
The Bitcoin Cash course develops independently, even if Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are frequently mentioned together.&amp;nbsp;Thus, the success of this digital currency is not inextricably linked to the success of other cryptocurrencies.

There is a possibility that Bitcoin Cash could become an accepted and practical payment method in the online world. Due to the advantages of its own protocol, Bitcoin Cash could catch up with Bitcoin in terms of payment volume.

The Bitcoin Cash price development
In the years from 2020 to 2021, Bitcoin Cash&apos;s price experienced a dramatic increase and was even quoted at times at over 1500 dollars in May of that year. In spite of this, Bitcoin Cash has not been able to return to its previous all-time high, which it already reached on December 20, 2017 at a level of USD 4,355.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can continue to be ranked among the top 25 cryptocurrencies and has not completely lost relevance. Additionally, it has been able to attract some exciting new partners, which suggests that the cryptocurrency may receive a new boost later in 2022. It remains an exciting time for the cryptocurrency.

Previous Bitcoin Cash price development in 2022
Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash, have been in a bear market since the last high in May 2021. In 2022, the price will continue its downward trend, falling from &amp;euro; 397.47 to &amp;euro; 282.73 and thus by 28.79%. BCH can only hold on to 23rd place among the largest crypto currencies by market capitalization.
Bitcoin Cash Forecast 2023 to 2025
Further performance will certainly be determined by the performance of the crypto market, but the forecast for 2023 and the future is encouraging. First and foremost, however, a forecast over several years is always extremely speculative in the world of crypto currencies. It is possible for a great deal to happen in three years, but we believe that Bitcoin Cash is in a relatively good position for the future. At the same time, there have been many interesting developments regarding Bitcoin Cash recently, and efforts are being made to further enhance its advantages.&amp;nbsp;Given the general crypto boom and the increased transactions, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin Cash can deliver on its promises.
In general, a great deal depends on whether BCH is able to retain and expand its competitive advantage , or whether it falls behind other cryptocurrencies. Currently, we are in an exciting phase for this decision, which could make Bitcoin Cash very interesting to invest in.
Here is a brief perspective on the views of different sources:

According to the Smarteum website, Bitcoin Cash is likely to have a very bright future as a whole. According to their estimates, the coin will be worth approximately 10,000 US dollars in five years. Furthermore, you do not believe in a miracle, but you also emphasize the high volatility of the coin as well as the importance of whether Bitcoin Cash is able to engage with its competitors effectively.
Digitalcoinprice believes in a less strong bull market: they believe the price will rise until 2023, peaking around $2500, which would represent a gain of over 300% over current prices.&amp;nbsp;In addition, Digitalcoinprice emphasizes that forecasts for crypto currencies, including BCH, are very difficult, and should not be regarded as definitive.

Bitcoin cash mining
In part, mining Bitcoin Cash can be performed using the same devices as Bitcoin mining. The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, however, is continuously increasing due to the increasing number of coins mined. Consequently, mining Bitcoin Cash becomes more and more attractive compared to mining Bitcoin.
Additionally, Bitcoin Cash&apos;s developers have further reduced the difficulty of mining their coin, hoping to attract the attention of the mining community. In the event that this project is successful, a lot of computing power will be available to Bitcoin Cash and its price, as well as the general demand for the coin, will be increased.
What is the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?
In spite of the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are based on nearly the same substructure of the Bitcoin blockchain, they remain entirely independent of each other.&amp;nbsp;As a result of a fork of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash was created when a large number of developers refused to accept the shortcomings of the protocol, and created their own platform.
So why do we need Bitcoin Cash?
By introducing Bitcoin Cash, there are some adjustments to Bitcoin that solve some of the known problems: due to its great popularity and low transaction capacity, Bitcoin payments have become expensive.&amp;nbsp;The fees are as high as 20 euros in some instances. Due to the large block size, Bitcoin Cash has a major advantage here, as it requires a transaction fee of less than 0.01 Euro per transaction.

What happens after the Bitcoin Cash purchase?
As soon as possible after purchasing Bitcoin Cash, you should store it securely. As a next step, you can decide whether to resell the coins one day, and at what price. The most profitable option should be obvious. You will need a wallet if you wish to keep the coins in your possession throughout this period.
Bitcoin cash storage
Immediately following the purchase of Bitcoin Cash, the coins should be moved into a wallet, a digital wallet, as soon as possible. In the case of opening an account with a crypto exchange, you will also be provided with a wallet. The wallet is usually credited automatically.
This coupling has the disadvantage that the exchange operators have access to the wallet and therefore control it. Your wallet is also at risk if the exchange is hacked. Alternatively, you can use an external wallet service. Be sure to pay attention to seriousness here!

Bitcoin cash sale
It is essentially the same as buying Bitcoin Cash, except that you are selling it.&amp;nbsp;In the ideal scenario, you should use the same platform for both the purchase and the sale.
Bitcoin Cash Pros and Cons
Bitcoin Cash /BCH) offers, especially compared to Bitcoin (BTC), some advantages but also some disadvantages.&amp;nbsp;Which exactly these are, and how they affect the function and performance, we clarify in the following.
Advantage

Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size than Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp;This makes it possible to execute many&amp;nbsp;more transactions per second&amp;nbsp;.
In addition, this leads to significantly&amp;nbsp;lower transaction fees&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;While with Bitcoin you sometimes pay over 20 &amp;euro; for a transaction, with Bitcoin Cash less than 0.01 Euro per transaction are due.
Another advantage of Bitcoin Cash is its great&amp;nbsp;similarity to Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp;This allows easy integration of the Bitcoin Cash platform into applications that already support Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp;Hence the great support for the currency BCH.

Disadvantages

Bitcoin Cash is significantly&amp;nbsp;less popular than Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;Although the currency is in the top 20 most popular cryptocurrencies, it is still in the shadow of Bitcoin.
This has an impact on&amp;nbsp;price developments&amp;nbsp;, where we notice that the price of Bitcoin has recently risen more than twice as fast as that of Bitcoin Cash.
The advantages of Bitcoin Cash may also be negated by the evolution of Bitcoin. If features are introduced to the Bitcoin protocol that dramatically speed up and reduce the cost of transactions, Bitcoin Cash might lose its competitive advantage.

Thus, you would be wise to keep an eye out for crypto trading platforms that are licensed, read reviews and testimonials, and carefully examine each provider.
        
    

    
        Is it possible to buy Bitcoin Cash anonymously?
        
             The basic idea of ​​cryptocurrencies is anonymity.&amp;nbsp;That&apos;s why crypto fans can of course purchase Bitcoin Cash anonymously.&amp;nbsp;To purchase, you do not have to provide your address or any other data, only when opening an account.&amp;nbsp;Your data is therefore stored with the crypto exchanges or your broker.&amp;nbsp;These can be viewed by the authorities in case of doubt.&amp;nbsp;So the matter is not completely anonymous.&amp;nbsp;One way to acquire Bitcoin Cash anonymously is through mining!
