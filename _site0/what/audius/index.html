<h2 id="2">What is Audius?</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Audio is the leading decentralized music streaming platform with over 5 million monthly users. Most importantly, it is intended to compensate for the shortcomings of the current music industry and to revolutionize it by giving artists full access to the works they publish as well as almost 100% of the proceeds from marketing and sales - a first for the music industry, which has so far been dominated by many middlemen and record companies.</p>
<p>Audius token (AUDIO) is helpful in advancing the change in the industry, on the one hand ensuring the smooth functioning of the platform, and on the other hand allowing users to directly support their desired artists. You must first purchase Audius if you wish to listen to the works of your favorite artists, then subscribe to or download music similar to Spotify.</p>

<p>Audius is a relatively new company, having been founded only in 2018. In 2020, the platform was launched and immediately reached 500,000 users. Users have increased tenfold since then. Meanwhile, Audius has been able to attract large venture capital firms, which is indicative of the potential of Audius and the Audius token.&nbsp;Audius has received investments from Binance Labs and Coinbase Ventures, among others.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="3">How does Audius work?</h2>
<p>Audius is a blockchain-based music service originally built on the POA network but currently running on the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>Audius does not charge based on the number of tracks played. Furthermore, the community ensures automatic quality control to prevent the posting of copyrighted materials on Audius. Users are also well advised to purchase and stake Audius, as this does not only influence the future of the protocol, but also ensures the stability, security, and quality of the platform.</p>

<h3 id="4">What makes Audius special?</h3>
<p>By staking audio tokens on Audius, you are not only able to download songs and works from your favorite artists, but also participate in their success. If you choose to purchase Audius, you will gain twice: from the price gain of the Audius Coin as well as the income generated by crypto staking.</p>
<p>Additionally, Audius offers artists completely new opportunities for self-marketing that were previously only available through record companies and other intermediaries. The Audius platform, for example, can accommodate bonus tracks or unplugged versions, which can then be monetized on a per-song basis.&nbsp;Additionally, artists can create their own content nodes so they retain complete control over their work - something that was previously unimaginable in the traditional music industry.</p>
<p>With Audius, it will also be possible to provide fans with exclusive content that can be viewed only by fans with a certain level of loyalty, which is determined by Audius stakes. These may include behind-the-scenes impressions, unique video content, backstage passes, or face-to-face meetings.</p>

    <div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question" class="faq-question">
        <h4 itemprop="name" class="faq-q">What is the current circulation of Audius (AUDIO) coins?</h4>
        <div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
             <p itemprop="text" class="faq-a">Audius issued an initial supply of 1 billion AUDIO tokens at genesis, of which 41% were allocated to founders, 36% to investors, and 18% to network expansion. The tokens will be unlocked gradually in accordance with a vesting schedule. As a reward for node operators, the AUDIO token was launched with a 7% inflation rate. Due to AUDIO's nature as a governance token, the community can vote on the distribution of the tokens. The tokens are currently in circulation and number 719,623,350.</p>

    <div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question" class="faq-question">
        <h4 itemprop="name" class="faq-q">Can I stake Audius?</h4>
        <div itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
             <p itemprop="text" class="faq-a">Yes,  you can stake Audius.A ERC-20 token, AUDIO resides on the Ethereum blockchain, which is currently Proof of Work, but is in the process of being upgraded to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The Audius network is secured by a network of node operators who have staked their AUDIO as collateral. To host their own content, artists may run their own nodes. AUDIO staked by node operators will increase the likelihood that their nodes will be used by artists and fans, enabling them to benefit from ongoing issuance and aggregated fee pools.</p>

What makes Audius special?
By staking audio tokens on Audius, you are not only able to download songs and works from your favorite artists, but also participate in their success. If you choose to purchase Audius, you will gain twice: from the price gain of the Audius Coin as well as the income generated by crypto staking.
Additionally, Audius offers artists completely new opportunities for self-marketing that were previously only available through record companies and other intermediaries. The Audius platform, for example, can accommodate bonus tracks or unplugged versions, which can then be monetized on a per-song basis.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, artists can create their own content nodes so they retain complete control over their work - something that was previously unimaginable in the traditional music industry.
With Audius, it will also be possible to provide fans with exclusive content that can be viewed only by fans with a certain level of loyalty, which is determined by Audius stakes. These may include behind-the-scenes impressions, unique video content, backstage passes, or face-to-face meetings.
