        <h1>Airdrop Guide: Crypto Airdrop List, Latest Tips and Explanations</h1>
        <p><strong>Crypto airdrops are giveaways</strong>&nbsp;designed to draw attention to new tokens.&nbsp;Investors are attracted via the airdrops or rewarded for their loyalty.</p>
        <p>Anyone who enjoys a Crypto Airdrop can look forward to some&nbsp;<strong>free coins</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Because a crypto airdrop is the free distribution of coins&nbsp;<strong>using the watering can method</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
        <p>But many people wonder&nbsp;<strong>if the crypto airdrops are really serious</strong>&nbsp;, where to get them and what to watch out for.</p>
        <p>We have therefore taken on the topic and tried to answer all questions in our&nbsp;<strong>Crypto Airdrop statement</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;On this page you will find everything you ever wanted to know about airdrop cryptos.</p>
        <h2>Crypto Airdrop Meaning</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>New tokens are announced and distributed free of charge via Crypto Airdrops.</li>
        <li>In order to get airdrop coins, one often has to promote the crypto project via social media.</li>
        <li>The Crypto Airdrop list mainly contains new and unknown crypto assets.</li>
        <li>Not all interested parties are always assigned crypto airdrops.</li>
        <li>Without a suitable wallet, you cannot receive crypto airdrop credits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are Crypto Airdrops?</h2>
        <p>Crypto Airdrop is the&nbsp;<strong>free distribution of tokens</strong>&nbsp;and crypto assets.&nbsp;A small group of recipients can then count themselves lucky and get a crypto asset transferred free of charge with an airdrop.</p>
        <p>Similar to a giveaway&nbsp;<strong>, real crypto airdrops are free</strong>&nbsp;and do not involve any disadvantages for the recipient.&nbsp;However, the recipients must have a&nbsp;<strong>suitable wallet</strong>&nbsp;in order to be able to receive and store the free crypto sample at all.</p>
        <h3>What types of Crypto Airdrops are there?</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Crypto airdrops as a giveaway</li>
        <li>Rewards for new wallet customers</li>
        <li>Reward for holding a cryptocurrency</li>
        <li>Airdrop after completing marketing tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Do I have to pay taxes in USA Crypto Airdrop?</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>No, not according to the current status</li>
        <li>A crypto airdrop is to be considered a random win</li>
        <li>Like winning the lottery, airdrops are therefore tax-free</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Are Airdrop Cryptos Really Always Absolutely Free?</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Most crypto airdrop promotions are actually free</li>
        <li>But sometimes there are costs.&nbsp;Especially if there is a task to open a new wallet.</li>
        <li>Then there are the supposed airdrops as a new customer bonus, but only after a first deposit</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How does Crypto Airdops work?</h3>
        <p>In some cases, the crypto airdrops are also&nbsp;<strong>distributed directly by the crypto wallet providers.&nbsp;</strong>In the majority of cases, this is a bonus that is given either to new customers or to users who have been loyal to them for many years.</p>
        <p>Again and again, the receipt of cryptocurrencies via Airdrop is subject to&nbsp;<strong>small conditions</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;So sometimes the free coins are only available after completing a small task.</p>
        <p>For example, from time to time you are asked to post something on social media about the cryptocurrency.&nbsp;Or there are the Airdrop cryptos, for example, only for people who sign up for the&nbsp;<strong>Telegram channel</strong>&nbsp;of a new crypto project.</p>

        <h4>Why are crypto airdrops performed?</h4>
        <p>The idea behind most crypto airdrops is usually that the developers want to draw attention to a new crypto project through the action.&nbsp;Therefore, the vast majority of airdrops are limited to&nbsp;<strong>relatively young cryptos</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
        <p>But the distribution of tokens via a crypto airdrop is sometimes also pushed by&nbsp;<strong>well-known wallet providers and&nbsp;</strong><strong>crypto exchanges</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Because long-standing customers can also be rewarded for their loyalty via Crypto Airdrops.</p>
        <p>A special form are&nbsp;<strong>regular bonuses</strong>&nbsp;, which are sometimes offered over a longer period of time.&nbsp;The reason for such crypto airdrops is usually that the holding period is to be extended.</p>
        <p>Airdrops&nbsp;can also be used to&nbsp;<strong>positively influence market capitalization .&nbsp;</strong>Because the price of crypto assets is formed by the balance between supply and demand, a longer holding period can push a new crypto project upwards.</p>
        <p>If the owners of the tokens do not always sell everything again immediately, but instead reduce the supply by&nbsp;<strong>holding</strong>&nbsp;it longer, the price can rise.&nbsp;Some Airdrop Crypto campaigns are therefore structured in such a way that the owners keep receiving small amounts of tokens as a loyalty bonus and are therefore more willing&nbsp;to leave the crypto asset in the wallet&nbsp;<strong>as a hold position in the long term.</strong></p>
        <h4>How do I get Airdrops?</h4>
        <p>The procedure is sometimes a bit complicated. Normally,&nbsp;the Airdrop Coins are only credited&nbsp;<strong>after certain requirements have been met.&nbsp;</strong>In addition to the task of promoting the coin, there is often the requirement that you have to open a new wallet.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Really free or only after a deposit?&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes the airdrops are tied to deposit requirements as well.&nbsp;Then you only get the coins after&nbsp;opening a new wallet&nbsp;and making the first deposit of Fiat credit.&nbsp;The provider Blockfi, for example, gives new customers a Bitcoin Airdrop worth USD 10 after the first deposit of USD 100.</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown wallets or big crypto brokers?&nbsp;</strong>In our opinion, it is better not to register with unknown airdrop wallets on the Internet.&nbsp;It is much safer to use regulated and well-known crypto brokers, .</li>
        <li><strong>Are there also automatic Crypto Airdrop finders?&nbsp;</strong>Most Crypto Airdrop Bots are really reputable.&nbsp;We haven't come across a really good airdrop finder yet.&nbsp;If you want to get the free coins regularly, you have to do the work yourself.&nbsp;Compared to regular trading, finding airdrops is probably less lucrative for most people.</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Don't waste too much time looking for supposedly lucrative airdrops.&nbsp;With reputable brokers , you can start trading right away and make much bigger profits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How do I use Airdrops?</h4>
        <p>Each airdrop has a slightly different procedure for getting hold of them.&nbsp;But as soon as you have the crypto asset in your wallet, you can use it just like other cryptos.&nbsp;So it is either possible&nbsp;<strong>to sell or save the crypto value.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A little patience can be worthwhile</strong>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies that are still unknown .&nbsp;Because if the price rises, receiving a cryptocurrency for free could later become much more lucrative.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>We therefore recommend holding the new coins for a long time, with the hope that a large price jump will one day occur.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How do I find the best airdrops?</h4>
        <p><strong>There are a number of Crypto Airdrop lists</strong>&nbsp;on the Internet&nbsp;where new projects are presented.&nbsp;Since the topic arouses a little less interest in Germany than in the USA, there is still no really good platform for&nbsp;<strong>Crypto Airdrops in German</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
        <p>The developers of new tokens often put information on the Internet via social media.&nbsp;The promotions are advertised&nbsp;on Twitter and&nbsp;<strong>Crypto Airdrop Reddit forums.&nbsp;</strong>Anyone looking to keep an eye out for future Crypto Airdrops 2022 should also keep an eye on the latest projects on the&nbsp;Crypto Launchpads&nbsp;.</p>
        <p>With some well-known platforms, such&nbsp;as Binance&nbsp;, there are&nbsp;<strong>always airdrops for existing customers.&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes new deposits or holding certain assets are rewarded with bonuses.&nbsp;If you already have a crypto broker, you can also ask your broker's customer service for free coins.</p>
        <h4>Are there also risks with airdrops?</h4>
        <p>Obtaining free tokens does not involve any risk in and of itself.&nbsp;Because the little crypto gifts are free.&nbsp;Even if the value of the coins should fall, you&nbsp;<strong>have not lost any of your own money.&nbsp;</strong>In addition, the cryptos distributed via an airdrop can also be sold.&nbsp;Nobody has to keep the Crypto Airdrops in their wallet for a long time afterwards.</p>
        <p>However, one must note that not all cryptocurrencies that rely on&nbsp;<strong>airdrops as a marketing tool</strong>&nbsp;will be successful in the long term.&nbsp;Some cryptocurrencies that are hyped up via freebies must therefore also be viewed critically.&nbsp;Because the method can lead to a&nbsp;<strong>short-term distortion of the market</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
        <p>When we look at the&nbsp;<strong>specific risks</strong>&nbsp;, there are&nbsp;<strong>two main scenarios</strong>&nbsp;to consider.&nbsp;The first would be&nbsp;<strong>a &ldquo;pump-and-dump scheme&rdquo; scenario</strong>&nbsp;, where a price is pushed up in the short-term by media-driven demand.</p>
        <p>While early investors&nbsp;can sometimes even make big profits in such developments by&nbsp;<strong>jumping off in good time , there's always the danger of missing the best time to sell.&nbsp;</strong><strong>But if you only wake up after the crash</strong>&nbsp;and then try to get rid of the tokens, you will often have to accept losses.</p>
        <p><strong>The other risk is</strong>&nbsp;that there are sometimes dubious crypto assets that are&nbsp;<strong>only used to raise capital for the issuer</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;These then try, for example, to achieve a certain level of awareness via airdrops.</p>
        <p>After that, money for a start-up or a supposed business idea is often to be collected via an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).&nbsp;As soon as enough tokens have been sold, the project will be stopped without a murmur, which can sometimes almost come as a&nbsp;<strong>bruise for the investors or even a scam</strong>&nbsp;.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;In order to avoid the risk of fraud, many investors prefer to rely on well-known cryptos and renowned brokers  instead of relying on unknown crypto airdrops.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How are airdrops taxed?</h4>
        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>topic of the Crypto Airdrop tax</strong>&nbsp;has already led to heated discussions.&nbsp;Because the Treasury looks at the cryptocurrency scene with eagle eyes and some experts feared tax effects, especially with the regular airdrops.</p>
        <p>However, because they are promotional gifts (and not interest or dividends),&nbsp;<strong>receiving airdrops is tax-free.&nbsp;</strong>Most of the tax advisors we know classify the Free Crypto Airdrops as random profits.</p>
        <p>Similar to a small lottery win,&nbsp;<strong>no tax obligations</strong>&nbsp;would be due.&nbsp;Because you can imagine Airdrop Cryptos like a&nbsp;<strong>chance find of a coin on the street</strong>&nbsp;, we also think this view is correct.</p>
        <p>If in doubt, it is always advisable&nbsp;<strong>to contact your own tax advisor.&nbsp;</strong>Because the legal situation surrounding the taxation of crypto assets is changing and the finance ministers are trying to cut off an ever larger piece of the pie.Conclusion</p>

        <p>What at first glance looks like a great thing is not always advantageous.&nbsp;The real value of the airdrops is often relatively small.&nbsp;Therefore, the profit potential is controversial.&nbsp;Not all Airdrop Cryptos are also successful in the long term.</p>
        <p>While no one would turn down a free giveaway, we think the strategy of looking for crypto airdrops is wrong.&nbsp;Because investors' time is better invested on modern trading platforms .&nbsp;For example, leveraged trading can often achieve more profit in just a few minutes than can be found with Crypto Airdrops.</p>
