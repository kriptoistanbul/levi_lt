<h1 id="1">Lazy Lions NFT: how big will it become?</h1>
<p>It is no secret that the non-fungible token (NFT) craze has taken the crypto world by storm in 2021.&nbsp;A project such as Lazy Lions NFT is expected to become one of the biggest players in the NFT industry.&nbsp;As a result of its progress over the past 30 days, the project is on track to become the undisputed third largest project in this field after CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club.</p>
<p>A unique collection of one-of-a-kind lions, Lazy Lions was launched during a lockdown in Sydney, Australia, and quickly sold out after the launch.&nbsp;A large online community supports the project, with each non-fungible token available for purchase and sale on the OpenSea online marketplace.</p>
<p>The lowest price of the Lazy Lions NFT was $2,330 after a month of trading on the market.&nbsp;Compared to Bored Apes Yacht Club, which had a low price of $965 at an appropriate point in its growth. This price currently has a reserve price of approximately&nbsp;$1.137,78, as of July 17th 2022, this price is quite competitive.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Lazy Lions project maintains its comparison with similar projects, despite the fact that non-fungible tokens have been recorded across the board over the past few weeks.&nbsp;There is no doubt that other top projects have already traded desirable NFTs for millions of dollars.</p>

<h2 id="2">Why has the growth been so rapid?</h2>
<p>A strong wallet distribution is a key component that can ensure the success of the project.&nbsp;Over 4,000 inpiduals claim ownership of the Lazy Lions.&nbsp;In the future, further growth will be indicated by this distribution.</p>
<p>Additionally, most owners are participating in the <a href="https://cryptocurrencynewspro.com/nft/" title="What is NFT" target="_blank">NFT</a> sector for the first time.&nbsp;Lazy Lions Founder Ashur said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's an exciting time to enter the NFT space;&nbsp;We firmly believe that this is just the beginning of a major development that will impact society as a whole.&nbsp;We have a lot of respect for the existing players in the area like the Bored Apes and CryptoPunks. However, that third place is really up for grabs and we're putting a lot of effort into making this place our own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our first month, these efforts have focused on building our community, particularly through Discord and Twitter.&nbsp;For us, the project is the community and the community is the project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lion's designs are relatable and clean, which is why owners trust them right away.&nbsp;A total of 160 unique characteristics were used to create each of these digital animals. These characteristics include the mane, clothes, expressions, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="3">A marketplace for lazy lions - Lazy lions on opensea</h2>
<p>With Lazy Lions, users can create a secure public community for a variety of digital files, including <a href="https://cryptocurrencynewspro.com/nft/nft-art/" title="What is NFT art" target="_blank">artworks</a>, and make purchases using Ethereum cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>One of the most expensive examples of the token collection has fetched more than $50,000, making it one of the most valuable token collections in existence.&nbsp;In the last week, Lazy Lions received more than 90 million impressions on Twitter, another area where the project has excelled.</p>
<p>In an interesting development, the Lazy Lions NFT roadmap focuses on its online community, offering token holders a wide range of exclusive offers and features.</p>
<h3 id="4">Lazy Lions NFT Stats</h3>
<p>There have been 2025 sales of Lazy Lions NFTs in the last seven days.&nbsp;The total sales volume of these transactions reached 9.44 million US dollars.&nbsp;Thus, the average price for a Lazy Lions NFT was $4,660.&nbsp;The proponents and owners say that the NFT has an NFT community for kings.</p>
<p>On the Ethereum blockchain, Lazy Lions is a collection of 10,000 Lion NFTs that represent unique digital collectibles.&nbsp;More than 160 properties are possible for each Lazy Lion.&nbsp;Therefore, it is unique and well worth the price.</p>
<p>A top secret location, Lazy Lions Private Island is a very secure location.&nbsp;There are only VIP members of the community who have access to the island, according to the developers.&nbsp;Ethereum is the platform that powers the island.&nbsp;In view of the fact that each lion is generated from over 160 possible traits, its rarity is assured.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Lazy Lion owners have access to its own private Discord channel.&nbsp;The community wallet is open to 20% as of September 16th 2021.&nbsp;Several things and purposes are served by this <a href="https://cryptocurrencynewspro.com/nft/nft-wallet/" title="What is NFT wallet" target="_blank">wallet</a> in order to ensure its longevity.&nbsp;Owners who are engaged in Discord will have access to Community Rewards.</p>

<p>For all Lazy Lions, 80% of new NFTs are free.&nbsp;According to the developers, all owners will receive an NFT banner image showing their unique random generated private bungalow.&nbsp;These bungalows are open and each Lazy Lion gets one.&nbsp;A Lazy Lions game will be revealed at the end with community prizes.</p>

<h3 id="5">ROARwards &amp; Bungalows</h3>
<p>In addition to Roarwards, your LL provides you with a number of other utilities. As a member of LL, you will gain access to exclusive content and be able to join 4200 other members on their Discord and Twitter accounts and earn rewards. As the Roarwards program continues to grow exponentially, it will continue to serve the community based on what collectors would like to use their rewards for.</p>
<p>The community was introduced to bungalows in late September, and they are available for free to LL collectors. The concept of bungalows is an interesting way to display your NFTs within your Twitter banner. Bungalows function similarly to a personal digital gallery, allowing collectors to edit and interact with their existing NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of displaying your NFTs all in one place might be ahead of its time. As of today, the banners are available for 0.015 ETH, down from 0.3 ETH at the time of launch.</p>
<p>Also, Lazy Lion's NFT project will be launched on Coinbase's highly anticipated NFT marketplace, which is good news for the community.</p>
<p>The LL pack has also released a new logo to coincide with the Coinbase announcement. Community members have responded well to the logo, and new merchandise is ready to be delivered to holders. </p>
