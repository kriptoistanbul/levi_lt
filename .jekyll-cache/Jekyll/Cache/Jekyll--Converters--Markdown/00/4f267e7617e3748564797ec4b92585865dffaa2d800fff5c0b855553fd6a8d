<h1 id="1">Buy Chia Coin (XCH) 2022: Guide, price and forecast</h1>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing unprecedented growth. A large number of investors are interested in alternative coins and new cryptocurrencies as a result of the enormous increase in the price of Bitcoin. With his new Chia network, BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen places an emphasis on sustainability.</p>
<p>With Chia, it should be easier to generate coins and anyone can do it. In this article, we explored what is behind chia farming and how it is performed.</p>
<p>In addition, we discuss a possible future prognosis and explain how and where you can buy the Chia Coin and what to expect.</p>
<h2 id="2">What is Chia Coin and what is behind the project?</h2>
<p>The Chia Coin is the cryptocurrency of the Chia Network, an opera source blockchain that consumes significantly less energy than other cryptographic coins.&nbsp;<strong>By using a new consensus algorithm, the blockchain promises improved decentralization and security.</strong></p>
<p>In many respects, the Chia Network is similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, however, what determines the creation of new coins is not the computing power, but the free storage space. The Proof of Work is replaced with Proof of Space, which is more resource-efficient because it consumes less power.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/chia/white-paper.webp" alt="chia coin" width="620" height="385" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Because of this, the Chia network describes itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin. The objective of this network is to create global financial and payment systems based on blockchain technology. Chia Network strives to create a public cryptocurrency that is tradable by anyone and that can be used by financial institutions and companies for their daily trading activities.</p>
<p>Chia does not intend to conduct an ICO, but plans to list the company's equity on a US stock exchange.</p>

<h2 id="3">What are the arguments for buying a Chia Coin?</h2>
<ul>
<li>As an alternative to mining coins, farming would save resources</li>
<li>More decentralized blockchain significantly better security than other coins</li>
<li>Language Chialsp offers security, transparency and user-friendliness</li>
<li>Modern tools enable intelligent transaction functions</li>
<li>Pre-farming to reduce volatility</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4">What is special about Chia Coin?</h3>
<p>Chia Network says:&nbsp;"We're green money!".&nbsp;Chai Network was founded by Bram Cohen with the aim of generating cryptocurrency by using unused disk space rather than high-energy computing power. As in agriculture, the purpose of proof of time and space is to fill up unused storage space.</p>
<ul>
<li>For increased security, the proof of space is in irrevocable agreement with the proof of time. This method is intended to ensure that the time between blocks remains constant.&nbsp;The security of the blockchain will be enhanced as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is not possible to mine Chia Coin. Chai Coin can instead be generated through farming.&nbsp;You can generate Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies using expensive hardware that consumes a lot of electricity during the processing process. Chia Coin generates its coins using vacant hard disk space throughout the world. Anyone with sufficient hard drive space can use this to farm Chia Coins.</p>
<p>However, sustainability comes at a cost. The price of SSD and HDD hard disk drives in China has already increased significantly as a result of an increase in demand.&nbsp;It is also probable that storage media will become increasingly scarce in the future. China's first crypto farms have already contributed tons of HDDs and SSDs to gain an advantage when Chia Coin begins trading.</p>
<h3 id="5">How does chia farming work?</h3>
<p>Chia Coin creators should cultivate their unused storage space, which acts as a farming plot. Chia Coins will be awarded to "Farmers" who add storage space to the Chia network.</p>
<p>However, farming has a very special advantage. In the Chia system, anyone who mines using large and powerful hard drives, referred to as a landlord, has a good chance of winning the rewards. Farmers with limited storage now rarely receive any rewards. As a general rule of thumb, the larger the storage space, the greater the chance of receiving Chia Coin as a reward.</p>

<h3 id="6">Chia Coin forecast: is it worth investing in Chia Coin?</h3>
<p>It is generally more risky to invest in new cryptocurrencies than it is to invest in established cryptocurrencies. In addition to the developers and the progress of the crypto project, the success of a cryptocurrency depends on many factors. Fundamentally, we can say that Bram Cohen, as the developer and inventor of the Chia Network, has already developed a significant amount of experience with the development of BitTorrent.</p>
<p>Chia Network expects that the Chia Coin will have significantly lower volatility than other cryptocurrencies as a result of the planned technology. Chia is to be introduced to the American stock exchange for trading as a digital derivative that resembles an ETF. Chia can be of considerable interest to financial institutions, corporations, and private investors alike if it is successful.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this project is still considered to be a vision for the future, and there are no guarantees that it will be implemented. Those who wish to purchase or exchange Chia Coin must be aware of the high levels of risk associated with new cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/chia/buy-chia.webp" alt="chia price" width="620" height="349" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>We believe it would make sense to invest in Chia Coin long-term should it establish itself. Chia Coin's goal to establish itself at financial institutions, as well as its comparatively high entry price, make it an interesting investment for making long-term profits.&nbsp;Because of the high entry price, we do not consider Chia Coin to be an appropriate short-term investment.</p>
<p>Whenever the price of cryptocurrencies is low, we recommend purchasing them. It is possible to predetermine a loss of deposits and a gain of deposits and to buy or sell coins accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="7">Tips for buying cryptocurrencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tip 1&nbsp;: Find out about technologies and projects in the background before you buy.</li>

             <p itemprop="text" class="faq-a">Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Chia Coins are not mined, but are instead created through farming. The network uses newly added and unused storage opportunities to generate new coins, similar to the principle of farming. A Proof of Space concept does not provide high-performance computing services, but as a reward for the storage space provided, coins are awarded. As a general rule, the more storage space provided, the higher the reward.</p>
