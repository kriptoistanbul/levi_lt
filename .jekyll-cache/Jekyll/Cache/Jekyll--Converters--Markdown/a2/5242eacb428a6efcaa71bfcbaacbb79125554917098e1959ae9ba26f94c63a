<p>The invention of the blockchain has significantly changed the development of the financial sector.&nbsp;One of the most famous projects is Ethereum.&nbsp;It allows you to create smart contracts for transactions between 2 or more parties.&nbsp;However, this network was found to have deficiencies in scalability.&nbsp;As a result, Ethereum has competitors, one of which was the TRON project.&nbsp;This blockchain, which has its own coin, serves the entertainment content segment.&nbsp;A detailed overview of the Tron (TRX) cryptocurrency will allow the visitor to view the project from all sides, understand its strengths and the feasibility of buying an asset</p>
<h2>History of the Tron (TRX) Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>Project developer Justin Sun launched the Tron network in 2017.&nbsp;His idea is to allow creators and providers of entertainment content to interact directly with customers within the blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;Not only did Sun want to do without a third party (such as Google Play or the Apple Store), but he also wanted to allow files to be distributed.</p>
<p>He brought in the best programmers, engineers and advertisers to develop the platform and run the ICO.&nbsp;In 2017, the Tron Foundation raised $70 million in an initial public offering shortly before China banned cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;It was one of the largest ICOs at the time and further increased the popularity of digital coins.</p>
<p>An interesting fact: the team managed to raise such an amount without any special developments (there was only a landing page), as well as with non-original project documentation.&nbsp;Sections of the White Paper were partially copied from other companies.&nbsp;The developer referred to the incorrect work of translators.&nbsp;Justin Sun drew public attention to the fact that the documentation does not contain the main theses.&nbsp;However, all versions of the White Paper, except for the Chinese one, were deleted by the team members.</p>
<p>In 2018, the architecture of the network moved from working on the Ethereum blockchain to an independent platform.&nbsp;In the summer of 2018, the company announced the purchase of the BitTorrent project, the most famous file storage system.</p>

<h2>Cryptocurrency Features</h2>
<p>The difference between the Justin Sun project and other startups is the concentration of the idea on a narrow range of tasks.&nbsp;At the same time, a wide audience was preserved.&nbsp;TRX cryptocurrency adapts the digital ecosystem for entertainment information.</p>
<p>At first, the project worked on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;This choice is driven by a quick decision to launch a peer-to-peer network.&nbsp;Later, the developers switched to their own blockchain with the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and the Validation consensus.&nbsp;Tron was one of the first platforms to implement this.</p>
<h3>What is Tron cryptocurrency in simple words</h3>
<p>Tron is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that provides services related to entertainment and finance.&nbsp;The purpose of the network is to give content creators full control over their data and the ability to earn a profit for their efforts.</p>
<p>Developers are looking to change the approach to the traditional media industry and decentralize the industry.&nbsp;For example, Facebook or YouTube controls the content that will be published and viewed by users.&nbsp;Most of the revenue goes to these companies, with authors and creators making a small profit.&nbsp;Justin Sun's project should change that.</p>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p><strong>Technical parameters of TRX cryptocurrency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wide global blockchain-based interface.</li>
<li>High scalability.&nbsp;Applications can be implemented in a variety of ways due to the project's extensibility and efficient consensus mechanism.&nbsp;The network works with an impressive number of devices.</li>
<li>High throughput.&nbsp;Increased transactions per second (TPS) has overtaken BTC and Ethereum in terms of everyday use.</li>
<li>High availability.&nbsp;The distribution method is provided by a more stable underlying network, user resource, and a higher fragmentation acceptance standard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Principle of operation</h3>
<p>The main goal of the project is to counter the high transaction fees charged by the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;This was the only uncontrollable disadvantage of Ethereum.&nbsp;The developers of Tron used this opportunity to increase the technological level of the platform and make themselves known in the digital space.</p>
<p>The main core of the blockchain is based on delegated proof of stake (Delegated Proof-of-Stake, DPoS).&nbsp;It is an advanced version of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>In the TRON network system, users initiate transactions without worrying about gas fees.&nbsp;Transaction fees are based on the concept of bandwidth and energy.&nbsp;This mechanism allows 15 transfers free of charge.&nbsp;Subsequent transfers are charged based on the estimated throughput of each individual transaction.</p>
<h3>Transaction speed</h3>
<p>According to the White Paper of the blockchain, the platform conducts 2,000 transactions per second.&nbsp;For comparison: the speed of the Ethereum network is 25 TPS, Bitcoin is only 7 TPS.&nbsp;Less transaction verification time contributes to the overall positive impression of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<h4>Distinctive features</h4>
<p>Tron is called the future of blockchain technology.&nbsp;It is developed by adding several Ethereum foundations to its base.&nbsp;Due to the absence of high transaction fees, this technology is ideal for the development of decentralized applications (dApps).&nbsp;The network ensures complete decentralization of programs and eliminates the presence of intermediaries.&nbsp;The platform has its own coin, known under the ticker TRX.&nbsp;The coin functions as the basis for all applications built on the blockchain platform.</p>
<h4>Tron Cryptocurrency Technology</h4>
<p>The official coin is issued on its own network, which is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and its virtual machine.&nbsp;For business models, this development is a strategic step that allows you to get high profits.&nbsp;For example, with the help of tokens, media content authors can issue their own digital assets and receive rewards for publications through the sale of coins.</p>

<p>Blockchain has its own set of TRC token standards to empower all types of transactions inside and outside the network.&nbsp;They provide the operation of the entire operating system of decentralized applications using smart contracts.&nbsp;The main standards of TRC tokens are listed in the table:</p>
<div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TRC-10</td>
<td>The most developed token standard that initiates transactions on the blockchain.&nbsp;It allows you to carry out transactions at a low cost without using the TRON virtual machine (TVM).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TRC-20</td>
<td>An improved version of the TRC-10 standard.&nbsp;The standard allows transactions of replaceable tokens, for example, cryptocurrencies on the TRON blockchain.&nbsp;Its function is similar to TRC-10. The only difference is that it is connected to the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM).&nbsp;This mechanism allows you to be compatible with ERC-20.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TRC-721</td>
<td>This is the standard for issuing non-fungible tokens.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<h4>Issue of the coin</h4>
<p>The developers have issued a limited number of coins, which is 100 billion. According to the CoinMarketCap portal, as of August 2021, 71 billion coins circulate in circulation.&nbsp;Cryptocurrency mining is not possible.&nbsp;The Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm does not involve mining.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The Tron (TRX) cryptocurrency is a focus on an innovative way of distributing content and on a technology that allows developers to program decentralized applications on the blockchain.</p>
<p>As of August 2021, more than 500 projects are running on the platform.&nbsp;Among them are games, social services, crypto exchanges and DeFi.&nbsp;The provision of Tron depends on the growing popularity of the platform among both developers and users.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>The main use case for the platform is to support authors by granting ownership of the content they create.&nbsp;This is achieved by storing and tracking information on the blockchain.&nbsp;Content creators can see how their creations are being used and how they'll be rewarded for development.&nbsp;The intermediary is eliminated, the authors receive money directly.</p>
<p>For example, YouTube has a central authority that can censor content, introduce ads, or otherwise restrict use of the platform.&nbsp;Blockchain-based services are managed either automatically or by the community itself.&nbsp;Let's say YouTube doesn't have a central headquarters.&nbsp;Any user then has a copy of its source code and a share of ownership based on the number of relevant tokens they hold.&nbsp;In other words, it owns the platform.&nbsp;If a visitor wants to support a favorite author, 100% of the tip will go to the creator's wallet.</p>
<h4>How to get</h4>
<p>You can become the owner of coins by exchanging cryptocurrency or fiat funds for a coin in various online services.&nbsp;Finding a coin on the exchanges is not difficult.&nbsp;The digital asset is presented on many resources.</p>
<img src="/assets/img/posts-img/trx/stable-coin.webp" alt="stable coins" width="512" height="512" loading="lazy" />
<h5>Purchase and exchange</h5>
<p>Tron is traded on almost all major crypto exchanges along with Bitcoin and Ethereum.&nbsp;You can buy an asset, for example, on the Huobi Global, Binance, Poloniex and KuCoin platforms.&nbsp;According to data relevant to August 2021, the trading volume reaches $1.17 billion per day.&nbsp;Before buying a coin on the exchange, you should familiarize yourself with the platform commissions, available cryptocurrency pairs, methods of depositing and withdrawing funds.</p>
<p>Coin can be converted in an online exchanger.&nbsp;This method is easier for those who already own virtual assets.&nbsp;The exchange is made in a couple of clicks without registration on the site or user authentication.&nbsp;However, often the conversion rate in such services is not as attractive as on crypto exchanges.</p>
<h5>Ways to earn money</h5>
<p>There are 3 ways to earn income on a coin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long term investment.</li>
<li>Active trading.</li>
<li>Staking.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Investments</h5>
<p>Tron is a speculative asset.&nbsp;Its use carries risks even for professional investors.&nbsp;It is important to understand that the process is calculated for a long time.&nbsp;Digital currencies are highly volatile, and in a short period of time, the price of a coin can grow strongly or, conversely, fall.&nbsp;As part of the investment, you need to count on 1-2 years.&nbsp;To protect their investments, the user can place a limit order on the exchange.&nbsp;This averages the price and stabilizes the investment.&nbsp;Purchase within the order is carried out automatically.</p>
<h5>Trading</h5>
<p>Trading requires knowledge as well as patience.&nbsp;It is important to develop a strategy based on technical and fundamental analysis and strictly follow it.&nbsp;Fear, like other emotions, has a negative impact on the outcome of transactions.&nbsp;The decision to buy or sell should be made based on trading signals, an assessment of the news background and the behavior of other traders.</p>
<h5>Staking</h5>
<p>Passive income can be earned by holding coins to support the network.&nbsp;Owners invest coins, for example, on the Binance exchange.&nbsp;The reward is calculated from the blocking period and the number of invested coins.&nbsp;Profitability up to 8.17% is possible when staking for 90 days on the Binance platform.&nbsp;Bets are among the least risky investments, but there is also a chance of losing all funds.</p>
<h5>Where to buy TRX cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>A virtual asset is purchased on a trading exchange or online exchanger.&nbsp;If the user owns any other cryptocurrency and wants to anonymously buy a coin, then the fastest way is to turn to the converter.&nbsp;There are many exchange services, and they differ in the ways of depositing and withdrawing coins, as well as in rates.&nbsp;Cryptocurrency exchanges allow verified visitors to buy coins with fiat funds, as well as exchange digital assets.&nbsp;It is recommended to study the rating and reviews of the site, compare commissions and the possibilities of services.</p>
<h5>What affects the rate of cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>The following factors influence the quotes of virtual assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>General trends in the market.</li>
<li>Innovations from regulators.</li>
<li>The emergence of new competitors.</li>
<li>Public statements of experts and opinion leaders.</li>
<li>Developer action.</li>
<li>News background around the project.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Where to store Tron cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>You can keep coins both on the official TRX Wallet and in multi-currency services - for example, Ledger, Trezor, Metamask.&nbsp;It is recommended to be careful about the choice of storage, as in the event of loss of access or a cyber attack, the user will lose coins forever.&nbsp;Paper and hardware wallets are recognized as the safest.&nbsp;They do not require constant online access, so it is almost impossible for hackers to get to them.</p>

<h5>The future and prospects of the TRX cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>Developers work hard to make the network easy to use.&nbsp;Tron has successfully integrated a range of mobile apps, allowing visitors to reward each other with crypto tips (Piewo), rent bikes (oBike), and play.&nbsp;Tron intends to replicate the success of CryptoKitties with their Pet Planet dApp.&nbsp;New strategic partnerships are being prepared.</p>
<p>The Tron Virtual Machine (television dApp) is already available to visitors.&nbsp;The number and quality of applications and games on the blockchain will only grow.</p>
<p>The crypto project roadmap is scheduled until September 2027.&nbsp;It includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Great Journey"&nbsp;</strong>The project is focused on empowering individual creators to launch their own initial coin offerings to launch their projects on Tron.</li>
<li><strong>"Apollo".&nbsp;</strong>Development of a method that allows content authors to issue TRC-20 tokens.</li>
<li><strong>"Star way".&nbsp;</strong>Implementation of a monetized online decentralized gaming platform.</li>
<li><strong>"Infinity".&nbsp;</strong>Adding a game funding feature.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Analytics and forecasts</h5>
<p>A comprehensive review of the TRX crypto coin is impossible without an expert assessment of the future asset.</p>
<p>The price chart between 2017 and 2021 shows good volatility.&nbsp;The asset spent the second half of 2019 on a pullback, but ultimately held the position at $0.011.&nbsp;The bullish mood of the market led to growth and the establishment of a new high at the beginning of 2020, but in February there was another fall, which destroyed all forecasts.&nbsp;The price slowly recovered until September.&nbsp;In the fall of 2020, there was a breakthrough, and the quotes went up sharply.&nbsp;But the price leveled off again, and the coin traded in the $0.022-$0.025 range.&nbsp;The bull run affected many cryptocurrencies in the first half of 2021, including Tron.&nbsp;In April, the price reached $0.16 per coin.</p>
<p>The coin price prediction for 2021 was bullish as the asset showed a notable approach to the all-time high.&nbsp;But the fall of Bitcoin caused a resonance among all cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>It is difficult to make a long-term prediction given the high volatility of all digital coins and the volatility of the market.&nbsp;Given the momentum, the coin could rise to $0.1 by the end of 2021.&nbsp;This is a conservative estimate and an achievable goal.&nbsp;Portal WalletInvestor predicts bullish growth and a price of $0.3 until 2026.&nbsp;Digital Coin service specialists claim that in 7 years the value will be about $0.27.</p>
<p>If the crypto market does not go for another long-term pullback and the momentum continues until 2022, the Tron coin could reach $5.&nbsp;This is a bullish scenario.</p>
