<h1 id="1">NFTs and Web3 are now part of MasterCard's payments network</h1>
<p>Mastercard will offer its cardholders the ability to purchase NFTs through its payment system.&nbsp;A number of companies have reached agreements with the company in order to accomplish this, including Immutable X, Candy Digital, The Sandbox, Mintable, Spring, Nifty Gateway, and MoonPay.</p>
<p>Through new partnerships, MasterCard holders will be able to purchase non-fungible tokens on platforms owned by new partners without purchasing cryptocurrency in advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working with these companies to enable people to use Mastercard to purchase NFTs from partner marketplaces or through their cryptocurrency services.&nbsp;With 2.9 million of our cards worldwide, this change could have a greater impact on the NFT ecosystem,&rdquo; said Raj Damodaran, vice president of the company.</p>
<p>Moreover, he mentioned that a survey conducted by the payment system among more than 35,000 people in 40 countries indicated that non-fungible tokens are of interest to users.&nbsp;The majority of respondents (45%) indicated that they have purchased NFTs or plan to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard has partnered with Coinbase to facilitate the purchase of NFTs on the cryptocurrency exchange market since January 2022, as part of a joint initiative. It was launched in beta form in April.</p>
<p>Remember that the payment system filed trademark applications related to metaverses in the same month.&nbsp;In the documents, it is discussed that a media-enabled NFT and marketplace for digital goods will be integrated with payment transaction processing and e-commerce software in the metaverse.</p>
