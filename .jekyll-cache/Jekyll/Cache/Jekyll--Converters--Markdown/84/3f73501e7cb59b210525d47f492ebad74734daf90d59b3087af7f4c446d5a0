<h1 id="1">Flash Crash on Ethereum!&nbsp;On Uniswap, ETH falls below $950 &#128165;</h1>
<p>A temporary tumble in the price of <a href="https://cryptocurrencynewspro.com/what/eth/" title="eth" target="_blank">Ethereum (ETH)</a> was recorded on decentralized exchange Uniswap overnight, briefly falling below $950. A huge whale sell on Uniswap overnight caused the price of ETH to drop even further, as the price has already lost 20% of its value over the past day.</p>

<h2 id="2">The price of Ethereum has dropped below $950.</h2>
<p>Crypto investors and industry watchers were bracing themselves for a historic drop in Ethereum price during the past 24 hours, which saw Ethereum drop by nearly 20 percent over the course of the course of the day.</p>
<p>Last night there was a brief outage on the decentralized exchange Uniswap - albeit for a very short period of time.&nbsp;Upon learning that more than 65,000 ETH had been dumped on the market by a whale, the price of Ethereum plummeted to $950.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this was noticed on crypto-Twitter, since the price was extremely low compared to the spot rates on other exchanges.&nbsp;In the following example, the price hovered around $1,300 at the time.&nbsp;Fortunately, this was only a short-term flash crash on Uniswap - in the meantime, the price was able to recover in line with the rest of the market.</p>
<p>A short dip in the price of ETH below $1,000 was largely caused by the above-mentioned sell.&nbsp;SushiSwap and Uniswap were both affected by this.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, the investor sold 65,104 ETH from a vault of the DeFi app Oasis at an average sale price of nearly $1,156 per ETH.&nbsp;<strong>ETH worth more than $75 million was sold at this price in total.</strong></p>
