<h1 id="1">Buy Yuan Chain Coin (YCC) in 2022 &ndash; Guide, Price &amp; Forecast</h1>
<p>Cryptocurrencies consider blockchain technology to be merely a mechanism for facilitating the introduction of a quick, decentralized, and secure method of digital payment. Similarly, Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin on the basis of this original idea. It is important to note, however, that the blockchain has many other applications. In order to take advantage of their potential for accounting and contractual management, one can purchase cryptocurrencies, such as Yuan Chain Coin.</p>
<p>The fact that it is a copy of Bitcoin gives it a higher value than that of other cryptocurrencies. The purpose of this article is to analyze what is behind the currency, whether it is worth buying, and where to trade it.</p>
<h2 id="2">What is Yuan Chain Coin?</h2>
<p>This cryptocurrency was developed in China, and it has a number of advantages over other cryptocurrencies that are primarily used as a means of payment. In contrast to Bitcoin, Yuan Chain Coin comes with a blockchain that is capable of managing contracts and accounting for various companies.</p>
<p>The result is a cryptocurrency that is designed specifically to serve as an operations foundation for digital businesses that provide SaaS-like services.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.yuan.org/home?lang=en">Mission of YCC:
  <p>YUANCHAIN (YCC), a new generation of basic application public chains. Based on the YUANCHAIN public chain network, it is naturally suitable for building application contracts such as Defi, NFT, Dao, etc. By building an innovative POS33 consensus mechanism, YUANCHAIN is able to achieve fast block verification and generation while ensuring decentralization, balancing credibility and performance. To address the ecosystem expansion of application-based public chain, the YUANCHAIN supports the expansion of a two-layer and multi-chain architecture to create parallel public parachain on the basis of themain chain consensus, to improve performance and ecosystem expansion.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Main chain stability is similar to the Bitcoin, without virtual machines and has high concurrency, the TPS can reach 10,000 levels in the future.</li>
  <li>The primary hash logs on the parachain are written to the main chain, ensuring it is tamper-proof.</li>
  <li>Smart contracts and virtual machines can be used flexibly on parachains, with no impact to the stability and security of the main chain.</li>
  <li>The cross-chain interaction between the parachain and the main chain is efficient and stable, balancing the authority of the main chain with the diversity of the parachain.</li>
  <li>POS33+BFT, the innovative consensus algorithm, selects some coin-holding nodes as block producers and block validation nodes, which is similar to the jury system, balancing fairness and efficient consensus.</li>
  <li>YUANCHAIN supports the cross-chain bridge to achieve cross-chain transaction with Bitcoin and Ether network.</li>

<h2 id="3">Key Features of Yuan Chain Coin</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is a limited supply of 10B YCC.</li>
<li>It is particularly focused on corporate governance.</li>
<li>It facilitates accounting and smart contracts.</li>
<li>It is managed by the Yuan Foundation Ltd, owned by the Chinese government.</li>
<li>It is not suitable for mining.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does Yuan Chain Coin work?</p>
<p>It is a cryptocurrency that is based on the Ethereum blockchain, but is organized by the Yuan Foundation. Due to the centralized nature of the Chinese economy, the Yuan Foundation must also introduce a degree of centralization to its cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/ycc/yuan-project.webp" alt="what is ycc mean in crypto" width="512" height="463" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In spite of the dissatisfaction of many investors, Yuan Chain Coin can also serve as a platform for contract management and intelligent accounting for digital businesses.</p>
<h3 id="4">What makes Yuan Chain Coin so special?</h3>
<p>It is important to note that the Chinese government is backing Yuan Chain Coin. Contrary to other cryptocurrencies that have been banned in China, which have sometimes resulted in sharp price declines, bitcoin has not been banned in China. Several Ethereum mining farms were shut down last May, for example, resulting in a sharp decline in the cryptocurrency market from which it has not yet recovered.</p>
<h3 id="5">Yuan Chain Coin - How to buy it? What are the major considerations?</h3>
<p>The Chinese government oversees Yuan Chain Coin, so you should take this fact into consideration especially if you want to purchase it. Some of these advantages and disadvantages can be summed up thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cryptocurrency is centralized.&nbsp;The Yuan Chain Coin project, though it uses the blockchain, is essentially centralized, like IOTA. Because of this, there are opponents to it.</li>
<li>The project has tremendous growth potential in China.&nbsp;As a government-backed cryptocurrency, Yuan Chain Coin has great growth potential, especially since it is illegal to acquire other cryptocurrencies in China, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</li>
<li>We are only at the beginning of your journey.&nbsp;The Yuan Chain Coin has just begun its journey into the markets, so its value is expected to increase much further than that of other cryptocurrencies that have been around for years.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6">Should I invest in Yuan Chain Coin?</h3>
<p>Yuan Chain Coin is backed by the Chinese government, which suggests it might be a very good investment for the long term. Because it isn't permitted to use other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum in this country, it is therefore one of the cryptocurrencies with the greatest operational potential.&nbsp;To illustrate this point, 93% of Bitcoin transactions reportedly occurred in China before the country vetoed the cryptocurrency in 2016.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/ycc/ycc-price.webp" alt="ycc price predictions" width="612" height="612" loading="lazy" /></p>
<h4 id="7">A long-term investment</h4>
<p>Compared to short-term investments, Yuan Chain Coin is better suited to long-term investments. That's because the project has only just begun. This cryptocurrency is closely linked with the Chinese government's decisions regarding cryptocurrencies, which are still in the early stages. Therefore, the value of the yuan chain coin is likely to increase significantly as Chinese legislation strengthens its position.</p>
<h4 id="8">Buying on short notice</h4>
<p>By taking advantage of the natural fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, you can also invest in Yuan Chain Coin and make good profits in the short term. Although it seems that holding a cryptocurrency can provide higher returns in the long run, this is not the primary strategy investors are pursuing with this cryptocurrency.</p>
<h4 id="9">The Yuan Chain Coin's price development</h4>
<ul>
<li>As soon as the bull market of 2017/2018 ended, Yuan Chain Coin began trading in the cryptocurrency market. In spite of this, it reached a value of $0.02 per token in 2018.</li>
<li>Yuan Chain Coin peaked at $0.03 in the summer of 2019 in contrast to other cryptocurrencies that were flat until 2020.</li>
<li>Yuan Chain Coin crossed the $0.03 and approached the&nbsp;$0.04 in March 2021.</li>
<li>After the&nbsp;subsequent correction,&nbsp;it is currently stabilizing above the $0.01.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="10">Forecast for Yuan Chain Coin - Does Yuan Chain Coin feature any potential?</h4>
<p>Before 2016, when Bitcoin was banned in China, the Chinese market was Bitcoin's most significant market. Because of this, the market is very interested in all the projects that are being developed in China to replace banned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As opposed to other cryptocurrencies, Yuan Chain Coin is freely tradable in China, meaning the coin has a very high potential value and its price may skyrocket in the near future.</p>
<h4 id="11">Is now the best time to purchase Yuan Chain Coin?</h4>
<p>After hitting a high of about $0.04 not so long ago, the value of the Yuan Chain Coin has stabilized slightly above $0.01. Given the tremendous growth potential of this cryptocurrency, now is an excellent time to invest in it.&nbsp;<strong>Therefore, the sooner you purchase Yuan Chain Coin, the greater your chances of maximizing the returns on your investment will be.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/ycc/chainese-coin.webp" alt="yuan chain coin buy" width="412" height="274" loading="lazy" /></p>
<h4 id="12">Buying Yuan Chain Coin - What should you be on the lookout for?</h4>
<p>It is essential that you choose a platform that considers all the following factors before buying Yuan Chain Coin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prices are reasonable.&nbsp;Otherwise, you will have to pay too much and won't be able to withhold as much profit as you would like, which will negatively impact your profits.</li>
<li>Safety.&nbsp;Every trading platform offers different security features. Some platforms, such as Bitfinex and KuCoin, have been hacked in the past; others have remained unaffected.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrencies in various forms.&nbsp;Take advantage of the opportunity to invest with a broker that offers a variety of cryptocurrencies. This is due to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is often needed to purchase another cryptocurrency by selling one. You can maximize your profits by investing in as many cryptocurrencies as possible.</li>
</ul>
