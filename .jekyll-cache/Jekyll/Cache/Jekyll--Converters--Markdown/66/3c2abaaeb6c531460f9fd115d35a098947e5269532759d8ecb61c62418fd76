<h3 id="7">NFT Wallet Review: The 7 Best NFT Wallets in Comparison</h3>

<p>Below we compare the best NFT wallets to give you a good overview of the different options.</p>

<h4 id="8">Metamask NFT Wallet</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/nftwallets/metamask-nft-wallet.webp" alt="NFT wallet metamask" width="367" height="687" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>It is highly likely that the majority of investors purchasing NFTs have already heard of MetaMask, since it is the most widely used platform for sending, receiving, and storing NFTs. As of now, MetaMask has over 21 million active monthly users, an exponential growth over the wallet's initial launch in 2016.</p>
<p>MetaMask is available as a&nbsp;browser extension or as an NFT Wallet app for iPhone and Android.&nbsp;Supported browsers include&nbsp;Google Chrome and Firefox, with the setup process only taking a few minutes.&nbsp;One of the most attractive&nbsp;factors of MetaMask is the level of security, as the wallet passwords and keys are generated on their own device, which means that only the investor himself has access to the data and holdings.&nbsp;In addition, these passwords and keys, along with the secret recovery phase, are&nbsp;stored in an encrypted format&nbsp;to increase security.</p>
<p>If investors also&nbsp;want to use an NFT hardware wallet, MetaMask is ideal because the wallet currently&nbsp;supports Trezor and ledger wallets via the browser extension.&nbsp;However, in terms of NFTs, MetaMask only supports Ethereum-based assets.&nbsp;Unfortunately, MetaMask&nbsp;does not currently offer a function to display the NFTs, so they are only displayed as tokens in the menu.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of the Metamask NFT Wallet</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Perfectly combined with the NFT LaunchPad</li>
<li>Can be connected to hardware wallets</li>

<p>The dedicated NFT wallet offered by Crypto.com is one of the most attractive aspects of the platform. You can download this wallet from the Apple App Store or Google Play store titled "Crypto.com DeFi Wallet".&nbsp;With over 100 cryptocurrencies supported, it makes it convenient to hold the cryptocurrencies required for NFT trading.</p>
<p>Designed to look like a gallery, the NFT section contains a selection of selected NFTs at the top and the rest at the bottom, arranged according to collection.&nbsp;In the wallet, users are able to store NFTs based on the Cronos Blockchain, Crypto.org Blockchain, as well as Ethereum-based NFTs.</p>
<p>It is also easy to receive NFTs through Crypto.com's wallet, as it provides a dedicated wallet address that facilitates NFT transfers.&nbsp;Through Crypto.com, investors are able to send NFTs to others with just a few clicks, and they are also able to share NFTs on social media platforms.&nbsp;Moreover, the wallet provides users with the opportunity to earn interest on their own stored crypto assets.</p>

<p>A Coinbase Wallet enables users to securely store their digital art and crypto locally on their own devices, giving them complete control over their digital assets. According to Coinbase, the assets placed in the wallet are not owned by the company.&nbsp;All Coinbase users have access to the Coinbase NFT Wallet for free.&nbsp;On the desktop version, users have access to a tab that allows them to view NFTs associated with their wallet addresses.&nbsp;Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, and Optimism are among the networks that Coinbase supports, as well as assets that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p>NFT wallets come in a variety of designs, as described in the previous sections.&nbsp;MetaMask is one of the best NFT providers.&nbsp;This provider has emerged as the winner of the NFT Wallet test, due to its ideal connection to the best marketplace, NFT LaunchPad.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 5: Buy and trade NFTs via LaunchPad</strong></p>
<p>With the MetaMask Wallet, you can now trade the wide range of NFTs available on the NFT LaunchPad.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Optionally receive and send NFTs</strong></p>
<p>NFTs can be obtained by scanning or copying the wallet address and sending it to the sender.&nbsp;Once the on-chain confirmation has been received, wait for it.</p>
<p>Tap on the desired NFT and click on the "Send" button, then enter the recipient's wallet address.&nbsp;When you send an NFT, you are transferring ownership of your own property to the recipient.&nbsp;NFTs can only be sent one at a time, so this process must be repeated for each NFT.</p>
<h5 id="17">Why do you need a wallet for NFTs?</h5>
<p>In spite of the fact that the best NFT apps make it easy for investors to buy and sell NFTs, they are still recommended to set up a dedicated wallet to store their digital assets over the long term.&nbsp;Since many NFT marketplaces have centralized features, holding NFTs on the marketplace where they were purchased is considered a riskier strategy.&nbsp;This makes them more susceptible to cyberattacks or hacking, which may pose a risk to NFT property.</p>
<p>It is possible for investors to transfer NFTs from the marketplace to their own wallets and securely store them for the long term by setting up a dedicated NFT wallet. Wallets designed for NFTs are specifically designed for this purpose and often contain advanced security features.&nbsp;In addition, NFT wallets also handle many complicated elements in the backend, so users do not need to possess advanced technical knowledge to view or transfer their NFTs.</p>
<h5 id="18">Basic knowledge: How an NFT wallet works</h5>
<p>In addition to doing all the important complicated tasks in the background, NFT wallets ensure that the user experience is as seamless as possible.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it is imperative that you understand what is going on behind the scenes in order to protect your own NFTs.</p>
<p>When reduced to their bare essentials, NFT wallets usually perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stores private keys:&nbsp;A common misconception is that NFTs are stored in the wallet &ndash; this is not the case.&nbsp;As NFTs are stored on the associated blockchain network, investors are unable to possess them directly.&nbsp;The private keys of an asset are stored in NFT wallets instead of the "public keys".&nbsp;This private key allows access to the NFT by those who possess it.&nbsp;As a result, it is essential to maintain the security of this key.</li>
<li>Allows to hold cryptocurrencies:&nbsp;While investors are researching how to invest in NFTs, they are likely to quickly realize that the vast majority of NFTs are based on cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;Consequently, in order to purchase NFTs, investors must hold crypto first.&nbsp;In order to provide the best NFT wallet, this aspect must also be included.</li>
<li>Can connect to NFT marketplaces:&nbsp;Decentralized marketplaces like OpenSea require users to connect their wallets to the platform to make NFT investments.&nbsp;To use a decentralized platform such as this, investors will need to set up an NFT wallet that supports the network upon which the marketplace's NFTs are based.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="19">What requirements should a good NFT wallet meet?&nbsp;Functions &amp; Special Features</h5>
<p>The features and functions of a Bitcoin wallet vary depending on its type.&nbsp;When selecting a Bitcoin wallet, we demonstrate what you should take into consideration in our detailed Bitcoin Wallet Test.</p>
<h5 id="20">Compatibility</h5>
<p>It is possible that you will not be able to purchase or sell NFTs if the NFT Wallet is not supported by the marketplace.&nbsp;Investors should take a look at the details or website of an NFT wallet before choosing one to ensure compatibility with the desired NFT marketplace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be determined which blockchains are supported by the NFT Wallet, but we will discuss this in more detail in a later section.</p>
<h5 id="21">Usability</h5>
<p>An intuitive user interface facilitates the purchase and sale of NFTs.&nbsp;Generally, online NFT wallets are the most user-friendly.&nbsp;It is also common for desktop NFT wallets and mobile NFT wallets to be user-friendly.&nbsp;When using hardware wallets, such as the NFT Wallet Ledger, you must always connect the wallet to the Internet via another device and with a USB cable in order to transfer NFTs.</p>

<p>It is possible for NFTs to be worth thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars.&nbsp;As a result, NFT wallets should be as secure as possible.&nbsp;Hardware NFT wallets usually offer the highest level of security.&nbsp;Here it is virtually impossible for&nbsp;attackers to steal the private key from the provider's servers&nbsp;or the data storage of their own smartphone.</p>
<p>When choosing an online wallet provider, it is important that they are reputable and secure, as well as having experience in the market, if possible.t.&nbsp;By doing so, platform risks are minimized.</p>
<p>PC and mobile NFT wallets, however, are only as secure as the device used to access them.&nbsp;An infected computer or mobile phone could easily be infected with spyware, which would allow the private key to be easily obtained and misused.</p>
<h5 id="23">Customer</h5>
<p>Customer service is not offered by every NFT wallet.&nbsp;In many cases, only large companies, such as Crypto.com or Coinbase, are able to provide fast live chat support and good telephone support.</p>
<p>The difficulty of receiving good and reliable answers to urgent questions in a timely manner can be greater if you use a hardware wallet or a smaller provider.</p>
<h5 id="24">Multichain</h5>
<p>Some NFTs are supported by other platforms as well as the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;Investors should choose a wallet that is compatible with as many blockchains as possible.&nbsp;Popular other NFT blockchains include the Binance Blockhain, the Crypto.org Blockchain and the Cronos Blockchain.</p>

<h5 id="25">Is it possible to create NFT wallets for free?</h5>
<p>Especially for beginners, it is important that you pay&nbsp;little or no fees&nbsp;if you want to create an NFT wallet.&nbsp;Unfortunately, for this reason, an NFT hardware wallet such as the NFT Wallet Ledger &ndash; even if it is particularly secure &ndash; is rather impractical for beginners, as the costs are relatively high here.</p>
<p>Other NFT wallets are much more suitable for beginners, as&nbsp;these NFT wallets are completely free.&nbsp;Especially mobile or desktop wallet are recommended here.&nbsp;If you want to create an NFT wallet easily and free of charge at the start, you can log in to Crypto.com in just a few minutes.</p>
