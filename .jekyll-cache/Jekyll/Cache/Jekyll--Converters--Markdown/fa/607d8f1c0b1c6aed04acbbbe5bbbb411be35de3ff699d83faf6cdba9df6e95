<h1 id="1">What is Cosmos (ATOM)?</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://v1.cosmos.network/intro">More than anything, Cosmos is not a product but an ecosystem built on a set of modular, adaptable and interchangeable tools. Developers are encouraged to join the effort to improve existing tools and create new ones in order to make the promise of blockchain technology a reality. These tools are the foundation needed to create the decentralized internet and global financial system of tomorrow.</blockquote>
<p>Cosmos is a blockchain network that aims&nbsp;<strong>to create a network of cryptocurrencies</strong>&nbsp;connected by code that will streamline cryptocurrency transactions.&nbsp;ATOM is a cryptocurrency native to this platform and powered by Cosmos Hub, a proof-of-stake blockchain.</p>
<p>In this article we will talk about what exactly is behind the project and how Cosmos works.&nbsp;Furthermore, we give a detailed&nbsp;<strong>Cosmos purchase instructions</strong>&nbsp;and look at the course history so far.&nbsp;Finally, we make a forecast of how ATOM will potentially develop in the future and whether an investment is worthwhile.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Cosmos is a blockchain network that aims to enable independent blockchains to communicate with each other in a seamless manner.&nbsp;This allows them&nbsp;<strong>to exchange data and conduct transactions</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/assets/img/posts-img/atom/cosmos-atom-news.webp" alt="atom mining" width="620" height="349" loading="lazy" />
<p>The main problem that Cosmos solves is the lack of interoperability in the market.&nbsp;The Cosmos blockchain aims to provide an ecosystem in which dApps from different blockchain networks&nbsp;<strong>can communicate seamlessly with each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Cosmos began years before its release date.&nbsp;This platform came about when developer Jae Kwon&nbsp;<strong>introduced Tendermint to the industry in 2014</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In April 2017, Cosmos secured this success through an ICO and it took the platform less than an hour to reach its goal.&nbsp;In December 2018 the network started testing and after a few months the main network of Cosmos was launched.</p>
<h2 id="2">Buy Cosmos (ATOM) &ndash; What you should pay attention to</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Cosmos has a market cap of&nbsp;<strong>$2,123,070,921</strong>&nbsp;and has</li>
<li><strong>a total of 218,433,363.95 ATOMs</strong>&nbsp;in circulation.&nbsp;It is also one of the most popular cryptocurrencies worldwide for the innovation in the market.</li>
<li>Many users might find Cosmos (ATOM) attractive due to the approach and goal of facilitating interoperability between blockchains.&nbsp;Cosmos describes itself as &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>Blockchain 3.0</strong>&nbsp;&rdquo;, has a user-friendly infrastructure and aims to ensure this user-friendliness for all of its users.</li>
<li>Another important point to note about Cosmos ATOM is its&nbsp;<strong>scalability</strong>&nbsp;, which means it can handle more transactions per second than any other type of blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3">What makes Cosmos (ATOM) special?</h2>
<p>What sets Cosmos apart from other types of projects is its focus on customization and interoperability.&nbsp;Cosmos fosters an ecosystem of networks where data and tokens are shared in a convenient way,&nbsp;<strong>without the need for a central party</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;All independent blockchains created within Cosmos are connected to the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the current status of each individual blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Cosmos is needed in the market as the&nbsp;cryptocurrency&nbsp;industry needs&nbsp;<strong>some unification</strong>&nbsp;to ensure that all parties benefit positively, both the users, the community and the developers.</p>
<img src="/assets/img/posts-img/atom/atom.webp" alt="cosmos news" width="620" height="320" loading="lazy" />
<div>
<div>
<p>Investing in ATOM allows you to vote on network updates.&nbsp;On the other hand, Cosmos (ATOM) rewards investors with a small percentage of the reward according to the tokens wagered.&nbsp;Therefore, the ATOM limit is adjustable depending on the amount of tokens invested.&nbsp;Additionally, ATOM's value may increase as more blockchain networks are built on this platform.&nbsp;The cryptocurrency is&nbsp;<strong>the 27th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="4">The most important things in brief about Cosmos (ATOM)</h3>
<p>An important point to consider when investing in this cryptocurrency is that there are&nbsp;<strong>not many ways</strong>&nbsp;to access ATOM.&nbsp;The coin can be bought through certain providers like&nbsp;eToro&nbsp;which is one of the most recognized platforms.&nbsp;The currency can also be obtained through an exchange.&nbsp;With both methods, however, you need a wallet to exchange cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Cosmos (ATOM) has many advantages for investors, however, the investment area is extremely risky.&nbsp;With its goals, Cosmos (ATOM) can satisfy a great need in the blockchain area and is therefore something completely new for investors.&nbsp;It is a cryptocurrency with the&nbsp;<strong>potential to grow in the stock market</strong>.&nbsp;One thing that corrects this is that at least Binance has included this value showing the potential of Cosmos (ATOM).</p>

<h3 id="5">Do you need a Cosmos (ATOM) wallet?</h3>
<p>To safely invest in Cosmos (ATOM), you need an electronic wallet, better known as a&nbsp;crypto wallet&nbsp;.&nbsp;It is advisable to get one that suits the needs of the investor and can bring as much profit as possible.</p>
<p>This allows ATOM tokens to be easily and securely stored.&nbsp;The Cosmos wallet &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>Comostation</strong>&nbsp;&rdquo; works as a universal wallet that securely protects assets and keeps token passwords private.</p>
<h3 id="6">What is Cosmos (ATOM) Mining?</h3>
<p>Mining is a process by which new coins are brought into circulation.&nbsp;This is done with the help of computers that solve extremely complex mathematical problems.&nbsp;Mining is extremely attractive to investors because it&nbsp;offers&nbsp;<strong>miners a reward for their work.&nbsp;</strong>These rewards are crypto tokens. </p>
<p>The newly mined cryptocurrencies are used for payment transactions, are circulated and thus other users of the network can buy cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;In this case, they are called &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>validators</strong>&nbsp;&rdquo;, which correspond to the role of miners and receive compensation or block fees.</p>
<h3 id="7">Would you rather buy real Cosmos (ATOM) coins or Cosmos CFDs?</h3>
<p>Cosmos (ATOM) can be purchased in the form of real currency or tokens, as well as through a contract for&nbsp;difference or CFD&nbsp;.&nbsp;Here we will explain both options:</p>
<h4 id="8">Cosmos Coins</h4>
<p>Cosmos (ATOM) can be purchased through a cryptocurrency exchange&nbsp;<strong>with a crypto wallet</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;This can be done with a broker where you buy the cryptocurrencies you want and then transfer them from the broker's wallet to another wallet to then exchange them into ATOM.</p>
<img src="/assets/img/posts-img/atom/cosmos-price.webp" alt="cosmos atom price prediction" width="620" height="207" loading="lazy" />
<h4 id="9">Cosmos CFD</h4>
<p>Another way to buy Cosmos ATOM are so-called CFDs or Contracts for Difference, which are offered on cryptocurrencies with a high market share.&nbsp;The trader does not physically buy the coins but makes a profit on the&nbsp;<strong>difference between the buy and sell price</strong>&nbsp;of the coins.&nbsp;Investors can invest in ATOM without having to receive it in the form of tokens.</p>
<h4 id="10">Where can I buy Cosmos (ATOM)?</h4>
<p>Cosmos (ATOM) can be purchased through various options including cryptocurrency marketplaces and cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<h4 id="11">cryptocurrency marketplace</h4>
<p>The cryptocurrency marketplace is a space where investors enter to purchase a&nbsp;<strong>cryptocurrency or a security</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mostly these are online sites where you can buy or sell cryptocurrency.</p>
<h4 id="12">cryptocurrency exchange</h4>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange is where the&nbsp;<strong>exchange of cryptocurrencies for other</strong>&nbsp;cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies or altcoins occurs.&nbsp;A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers of that particular cryptocurrency.</p>
