I"j[<h1>What is Ripple XRP</h1>
<p>Ripple is one of the most common cryptocurrencies (ranks 3rd in terms of capitalization in August 2021).&nbsp;Despite the controversy surrounding it, the project still has a lot of followers.&nbsp;And this is easily explained.&nbsp;The project is not similar to other digital coins either in technology or in concept.&nbsp;An overview of the XRP cryptocurrency will help you understand the intricacies of the coin and find out its purpose.&nbsp;Based on this, it will be easier to evaluate the pros and cons, to understand the feasibility of investing in a coin.</p>
<h2>History of XRP</h2>
<p>In early 2011, 3 developers David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto got into bitcoin but noticed that mining was wasteful.&nbsp;They tried to create a sustainable value transfer system.&nbsp;Their first observations about the high power consumption and scalability issues that would plague Bitcoin proved to be accurate.&nbsp;In 2019, Ripple estimates that BTC mining consumed more energy resources than the whole of Portugal.&nbsp;Initial findings indicated that there would be problems if miners colluded to get more than 50% of the power.&nbsp;This risk remains for Bitcoin or Ethereum.&nbsp;Even in 2021, the problem is present, as mining power has been consolidated in China (until May 2021).</p>
<p>A trio of developers put in the effort to create a distributed ledger that would bypass these fundamental limitations of Bitcoin.&nbsp;Initially, the code was called Ripple.&nbsp;The registry included the XRP cryptocurrency to follow the same naming convention as Bitcoin.&nbsp;At first, the name meant an open source project, a consensus ledger, a transaction protocol, a network, and a digital asset.&nbsp;As a result, the name Ripple became widespread.&nbsp;For clarity, the community began to refer to the coin as XRP.</p>
<p>By June 2012, Schwartz, McCaleb, and Britto had finished developing the XRP Ledger code.&nbsp;When it began to function, 80% of the coins were transferred to a new company, which was engaged in creating scenarios for using the digital asset.&nbsp;The firm was originally called NewCoin, but was quickly renamed OpenCoin.</p>
<p>OpenCoin set itself the goal of turning the world financial system upside down.&nbsp;Larsen never believed that blockchain technology should be used to overthrow the current monetary paradigm.&nbsp;He believed that the most important innovations in history built on the great ideas that came before them, rather than supplanting them.</p>
<p>In the first conversations with potential clients, the team was asked about the differences between the project and the OpenCoin company.&nbsp;When the community started calling the coin XRP, the executives decided to rebrand it.&nbsp;This is how Ripple Labs was born.&nbsp;A scenario was created to use XRP Ledger and XRP to manage liquidity in cross-border payments.</p>
<p>On September 24, 2020, the XRPL Foundation was founded.&nbsp;It is an independent non-profit organization to accelerate the development and adoption of the decentralized XRP Ledger system.&nbsp;The foundation received an initial donation of over $6.5 million from Coil, Ripple and Gatehub.&nbsp;The funds were intended to fund the work of a growing number of creators and other members of the community.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, the company faced an unexpected problem.&nbsp;The US Securities Commission (SEC) launched an investigation and later brought the case to court.&nbsp;Representatives of the regulator insist that the nature of the asset refers to securities.&nbsp;If the SEC proves its position, then the project will face heavy fines, and will also be forced to report to regulatory authorities.&nbsp;As of August 2021, the situation has not been finally resolved.&nbsp;There is hope that everything will end well, and Ripple will not be recognized as a security.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Features</h2>
<p>The main goal of the project was to form a chain of direct asset transfers in real time, which would provide a cheaper, transparent and secure alternative to existing transaction methods, such as SWIFT.&nbsp;That is, the Ripple cryptocurrency was created as a competitor to conventional systems.</p>

<h3>What is XRP in simple words</h3>
<p>It is a payment platform and currency exchange network that handles transactions between countries.&nbsp;The idea is that the company acts as a trusted agent between the 2 parties to the transaction.&nbsp;The network quickly confirms that the exchange went through correctly.&nbsp;It is possible to convert coins into various fiat money and cryptocurrencies, as well as goods, such as gold.</p>
<p>XRP is a coin that runs on the XRP Ledger and the blockchain created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.</p>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ripple coin (XRP) can be exchanged for any currency or asset with a minimum flat fee.&nbsp;This is a reliable platform with increased transparency, which eliminates payment failures:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides digital security and protection.</li>
<li>Instant payments - money is received at the moment when customers need it.</li>
<li>The company has gateways needed mainly by financial institutions.&nbsp;To connect them, "chains of trust" are used.</li>
<li>Instead of mining, there is a consensus mechanism for confirming operations.&nbsp;Several nodes that act as validators send and receive payments for users.</li>
<li>The platform is decentralized.&nbsp;There is no body that makes independent decisions, intervenes in the conduct of payments or appoints validators.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Principle of operation</h3>
<p>So far, it is the only blockchain company with payment products in commercial use.&nbsp;The XRP crypto allows you to get liquidity, while providing greater scalability than other virtual currencies.</p>
<p>The XRP Ledger (XRPL) system is fundamentally different from proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.&nbsp;Consensus confirmation follows the principle of anti-growth, which increases reliability.&nbsp;This gives the system a built-in mechanism: when security cannot be guaranteed, XRPL blocks the operation.</p>
<p>The principle of public blockchains is that any participant can confirm that each operation complies with the rules of the system.&nbsp;Transactions are open and everyone knows which ones are valid and which are not.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/xrp/xrp.webp" alt="principle of xrp" width="612" height="408" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Consensus is needed to solve the problem of double spending.&nbsp;This question comes up when there are 2 or more ways to make progress.&nbsp;The protocol ensures that dishonest participants cannot fool honest users into disagreeing about the state of the system.</p>
<p>Public blockchains do not have central authorities that dictate the rules of the system.&nbsp;Each participant chooses the ones he wants.&nbsp;However, clients that do not agree with the laws of the system will not be able to interact with each other.&nbsp;This creates difficulties and risks when changing the rules.</p>
<p>Validators help guard against an unintentional ledger fork.&nbsp;They coordinate changes to the rules of the system.&nbsp;However, validators cannot force a server to accept changes to laws that it is not specifically configured to accept.&nbsp;Approval by 80% of a quorum of participants for 2 consecutive weeks is required to come into effect after the introduction of amendments to the registry.</p>
<p>The validator consensus scheme provides a cheap, reliable, decentralized and fast solution to the problem of double spending.&nbsp;Its design also allows the network to be upgraded when the participants agree to do so, without the risk of accidental divergence.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work, with its high power consumption and transaction costs, has proven to be a technological dead end.&nbsp;Other consensus algorithms continue to evolve to enable decentralization at lower cost and risk.&nbsp;The XRPL consensus algorithm continues to be refined to improve robustness.&nbsp;The newly introduced Negative UNL feature improves the platform's ability to tolerate outages.</p>
<p>The option improves the responsiveness of the XRPL network by tracking validators that are temporarily offline.&nbsp;With this information, servers can adjust quorum calculations to account for inactive members.&nbsp;Because shutting down a node for a short time is not a sign of unreliability, Negative UNL helps publishers deal with scenarios where a node is down long enough to cause removal from the UNL.&nbsp;This reflects its disabled status.&nbsp;The network works without relying on it.</p>
<h3>Transaction speed</h3>
<p>This cryptocurrency can process 1500 transactions per second with an average ledger settlement (confirmation) time of 3-5 seconds.</p>
<h4>Distinctive features</h4>
<p>Digital asset features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ripple was not meant to be a currency.&nbsp;</strong>The platform was developed for banks and payment networks as a settlement, exchange and transfer system.</li>
<li><strong>All digital money has a ledger system that keeps track of the movement of each coin.&nbsp;</strong>Individual verifiers in the network (nodes) can confirm that the transaction is legitimate and that the recipient is the owner of the coins they are trying to use.&nbsp;This also applies to fulfilling the criteria for smart contracts or other blockchain-based automated payments.</li>
<li><strong>Consent is required from only 80% of the nodes.&nbsp;</strong>This allows transfers to run more smoothly with less potential for delays.&nbsp;Unanimous consensus makes the blockchain secure.</li>
<li><strong>The company controls the entire volume of offers and periodically sells cryptocurrency on the market.&nbsp;</strong>In addition to 45 billion coins in circulation, about 55% are now owned by Ripple Labs.</li>
<li><strong>More than 300 financial institutions operate on the RippleNet network, including American Express and Santander.&nbsp;</strong>The first helps to make money transfers cheaper, faster, more convenient for banks and their customers.</li>
<li><strong>The essential difference is that Ripple is still owned and operated by a private company.&nbsp;</strong>This contrasts the project with other cryptocurrency systems that are more public in terms of ownership and are not controlled by 1 entity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>XRP Technology</h4>
<p>The backbone of the XRP Ledger is a peer-to-peer network of always-on servers.&nbsp;They exchange transactions, participate in consensus, and process transactions.&nbsp;Everything else in the ecosystem directly or indirectly builds on top of this peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>Programming libraries exist in higher-level software, where they are imported into code and contain accessor methods.&nbsp;The intermediary software gives indirect access to the XRP Ledger data.&nbsp;Applications at this level often have their own data storage and processing.&nbsp;Programs and services interact with the registry at the user level.&nbsp;They also serve as the basis for applications and services of even higher value.</p>
<p>The peer-to-peer network underlying the system requires a reliable and efficient server to enforce the consensus rules and process transactions.&nbsp;Ripple manages and publishes the reference implementation of this rippled software.&nbsp;The server is available under a permissive open source license.&nbsp;Anyone can review and modify it, and republish it with few restrictions.</p>
<p>Each instance of rippled syncs to the same network (unless it's set to test for example).&nbsp;Has access to any communications.&nbsp;A server on the network keeps a complete copy of the state data of the entire XRP Ledger, as well as a snapshot of transactions and a record of the changes that these transactions made.&nbsp;Hubs can be configured to store more ledger histories and participate in consensus as a validator.</p>
<p>The server provides users with a rippled API for searching data, administering and submitting transactions.&nbsp;No programming libraries are needed to access the XRP Ledger, since you can use HTTP or WebSocket for a direct connection.&nbsp;This makes it easier to access the rippled API.&nbsp;Libraries transform data into forms that are easier to understand and recode.</p>
<p>RippleAPI for JavaScript is the oldest and well-maintained repository for accessing the XRP Ledger.&nbsp;Many middleware services work with programming libraries.&nbsp;The services access the XRP Ledger API and also use their own interfaces.&nbsp;They provide an abstraction layer to make it easier to build higher-level applications with common functionality as a service.</p>
<p>Unlike libraries, which are created and closed with the program that imports them, middleware services typically run indefinitely and have their own databases (relational SQL or otherwise) and configuration files.&nbsp;An example of such software is shown in the table:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Data API</td>
<td>Intermediate service on top of XRP Ledger.&nbsp;The Data API collects and transforms information so that you can query by time, filter by data type, or perform information analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>XRP-API</td>
<td>This is another middleware service that manages secret keys and provides a more convenient RESTful interface to the XRP Ledger for applications in any programming language.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>At the top of the stack, programs and services enable users and devices to connect to the registry.&nbsp;At this level, exchanges host XRP, gateways issue other currencies to participate in the decentralized exchange.&nbsp;Wallets use user interfaces to buy or sell a coin.&nbsp;There are many other possibilities, including additional services located even higher.</p>
<p>A good way for applications that are compatible with Ripple and many other assets is to use the Interledger protocol with settlements in local currency.</p>
<p>The rippled server software operates in several modes depending on its configuration.&nbsp;For example, the main order is P2P.&nbsp;It monitors the peer-to-peer network, processes transactions, and maintains ledger history.&nbsp;This mode is configurable to perform any or all of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validator.&nbsp;</strong>Helps secure the network by participating in consensus.</li>
<li><strong>API server.&nbsp;</strong>Gives access to an interface for reading data from the general ledger, submitting transactions, and monitoring activity.&nbsp;As an option, this can be a full history server.&nbsp;It keeps a record of transactions and activities in a ledger.</li>
<li><strong>Hub server.&nbsp;</strong>Transfers messages between other members of a peer-to-peer network.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issue of the coin</h4>
<p>Initially, 100 billion coins were produced.&nbsp;Further, no coins will be issued.&nbsp;Just over 46 billion units have been put into circulation.&nbsp;The rest is kept on the company's balance sheet, although it is almost impossible to control their distribution.</p>
<p>There were accusations in the press related to the fact that the release of cryptocurrency into free circulation is not happening as previously stated by the developers.&nbsp;In 2019, Coin Metrics analysts found 200 million &ldquo;extra&rdquo; coins on the market, which equaled $85 million.&nbsp;The original plan was that Ripple could sell no more than 1 billion coins per month.&nbsp;It is assumed that the number of coins will decrease as they are spent on each transaction.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>No physical resources are spent on mining, transaction validation also does not require costs.&nbsp;Therefore, the only thing the asset is backed by is demand.&nbsp;The limited number of coins in circulation protects this cryptocurrency from inflation.&nbsp;When registering new addresses, 20 coins are burned.&nbsp;It also has a deflationary effect.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Financial institutions and individuals can use Ripple to exchange assets.&nbsp;Now the Swift system is used for this, which is based on the fact that banks have separate accounts in all countries in which they operate.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/xrp/xpring.webp" alt="price" width="512" height="332" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Ripple offers an alternative with some advantages.&nbsp;One of them is money exchange with a low commission.&nbsp;There are many currencies that cannot be directly converted to another, so banks have to use US dollars as an intermediary.&nbsp;This results in a double commission.&nbsp;Ripple can be an intermediary currency, but cheaper.&nbsp;It also provides fast international transactions.&nbsp;The average transaction time on the platform is 4 seconds, compared to about 10 minutes for BTC or several days for traditional banking systems.</p>
<p>Xcurrent is a service that offers an alternative to the archaic Swift messaging system.&nbsp;The platform is designed specifically for banks and other financial institutions.&nbsp;The service solves the problem of cross-border payments and offers faster terms.</p>
<p>Coin, like other cryptocurrencies, can be used as a means of payment or an object for investment.</p>
<h4>How to get</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrency is different from other digital money technology.&nbsp;Given its nature, the coin cannot be mined or staked.&nbsp;Therefore, the only way to become an owner is to buy coins on one of the reliable exchanges or in numerous crypto exchanges.</p>
<h4>Purchase and exchange</h4>
<p>The asset is listed on such reputable and well-known trading platforms as Binance, Huobi, Bithumb, Bitfinex, FTX, Kraken and many more.&nbsp;As of August 2021, the coin is traded for over $5 billion daily.&nbsp;It can be bought on exchanges for fiat money or exchanged for other digital assets.</p>
<p>You can also get a coin in a crypto exchange.&nbsp;There are many sites on the network that provide conversion services.&nbsp;However, often these services have an exchange rate that is less attractive to users than on exchanges.</p>
<h4>Ways to earn money</h4>
<p>Since these are coins that have been released in the final amount, there is no way to get them additionally.&nbsp;Therefore, there are not so many opportunities to earn money with them.&nbsp;The only thing left is to buy coins and try to increase their number through trading.</p>
<h5>Investments</h5>
<p>The technology of the project is one of the most interesting among all cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;This allows us to hope for an increase in the exchange rate in the future.&nbsp;In this case, an investment is an easy way to increase assets.&nbsp;It is important to understand that the process is designed for a long time.&nbsp;Although digital currencies are volatile and can rise or fall in a short time, you should not expect to make money quickly.&nbsp;Investment implies a long-term approach.&nbsp;Therefore, it makes sense to buy coins with an eye for at least 1-2 years.</p>
<h5>Trading</h5>
<p>Active trading requires more than just knowledge.&nbsp;Patience and discipline are essential.&nbsp;It is possible to earn money by trading, but the key to success is the development of a strategy and, most importantly, strict adherence to the established rules.&nbsp;Emotions should not influence the decision to buy or sell.&nbsp;Knowing the techniques of technical analysis will facilitate trading.&nbsp;This will help you make decisions not on a whim, but relying on signals as a result of evaluating the moods of other traders.</p>
<h5>Liquidity pool</h5>
<p>A high exchange rate and a liquid rate add to the reputation of the trading platform.&nbsp;These parameters are affected by the amount of resources available on the platform, which it receives from users' wallets.&nbsp;The owner of virtual money has the right to use his savings to replenish the liquidity pool and collect a commission for this.&nbsp;So the participants give the opportunity to other traders to conduct operations, and the exchange to gain popularity.</p>

<h5>Where to buy Ripple</h5>
<p>The asset is widely distributed on trading platforms and exchangers.&nbsp;For example, crypto exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, Kraken, and Bithumb offer the purchase and conversion of coins.</p>
<h5>Where to store XRP cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>Holding coins is allowed in the same way as other digital money.&nbsp;The owner can store them on a crypto exchange or transfer them to special wallets.&nbsp;The option of storing coins on the account of the trading platform is considered unsafe.&nbsp;Many exchanges have been hacked, and there have been cases where user coins have been stolen.&nbsp;For long-term storage of digital assets, it is better to choose special services (Ledger, Trezor, Trust Wallet, Metamask) or hardware wallets.&nbsp;The latter option is the most preferable, since the coins are kept on a standalone medium without a network connection.&nbsp;Attackers do not gain access to virtual assets.</p>

<h5>The future and prospects of Ripple</h5>
<p>Ripple has a chance to become popular not only among banks and individuals, but also at the state level.</p>
<p>After the dispute with the SEC, 100% of the clients are outside the US.&nbsp;Most are now in Southeast Asia as regulators in Singapore and Thailand have classified the coin as a digital asset.&nbsp;Business is also booming in the Middle East and North Africa, Saudi Arabia and India.&nbsp;According to Ripple, cross-border payments account for billions of dollars of transactions every day.</p>
<p>There are many ways to use NFTs when it comes to digital collectibles.&nbsp;The company is working to ensure that its platform can support non-fungible tokens.&nbsp;This can greatly expand the scope and cause an increase in the price of coins.</p>
<p>Recently, China, Cambodia, the Bahamas and other countries announced that the issue of creating digital currencies is being studied by their central banks.&nbsp;The Federal Reserve is partnering with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to issue its own crypto money.&nbsp;This will increase interest in independent projects, as the need for liquidity and settlements between other countries will remain.</p>
<p>Due to a dispute with the SEC, the company lost a partner in the MoneyGram payment platform.&nbsp;The firm recently acquired a 40% stake in Malaysian financial services firm Tranglo, which is still awaiting approval from government regulators.</p>
