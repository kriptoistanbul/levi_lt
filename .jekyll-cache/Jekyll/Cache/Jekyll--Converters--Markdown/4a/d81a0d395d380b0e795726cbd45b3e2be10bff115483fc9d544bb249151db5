<h1 id="1">Buy BitTorrent (BTT) 2022: Fees, Forecast, Future and Price History</h1>
<p>In recent years, BitTorrent has become a popular peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for sharing files and torrents. BitTorrent was introduced in July 2001. TRON acquired BitTorrent in July 2018.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/btt/btt-projects.webp" alt="bit torrent projections" width="610" height="203" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In the months following TRON's acquisition of BitTorrent, several new tools have been added, including the dedicated native cryptocurrency token BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON's own blockchain based on the TRC-10 standard.&nbsp;At present, BitTorrent is considered to be the world's largest decentralized P2P communication protocol.&nbsp;However, is BTT worth purchasing?&nbsp;How does one purchase BitTorrent tokens?</p>
<h2 id="2">The most important information about BTT</h2>
<ul>
<li>BTT has a market capitalization of $3.8 billion</li>
<li>BTT has a 24-hour trading volume of $2.74 billion</li>
<li>The BTT&nbsp;price development is&nbsp;amazing.&nbsp;In 2021, the BTT token has already achieved a&nbsp;return of more than 1,200%.</li>
<li>Buying BTT offers&nbsp;high potential&nbsp;for risk-averse investors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3">Buy BTT or not &ndash; the most important questions</h2>
<p>The purpose of this article is to answer the most frequently asked questions about BitTorrent investments and to explain step-by-step how to buy BTT from Capital.com. Also, we provide information on which brokers or exchanges we recommend for the BitTorren token, as well as any fees and costs that may arise.&nbsp;<strong>Prior to purchasing the BTT token, it is important to answer the following three questions:</strong></p>
<h3 id="4">Why buy BTT?</h3>
<p>As with any investment, the first question to ask is "why". Why should I invest in BTT?&nbsp;<strong>Could the BitTorrent project be profitable and successful?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this question can be answered fairly easily. It has been quite some time since we have seen a token with such hype as BTT.&nbsp;In just 15 minutes, the entire ICO sold out (raising $7.2 million) due to the hype surrounding Justin Sun, BitTorrent, and Binance, which put their names behind the project.&nbsp;BTT is primarily intended to encourage BitTorrent protocol users to offer infrastructure services such as Dataseed and hosting in return for the tokens.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/btt/web3-coins.webp" alt="btt web3" width="240" height="135" loading="lazy" /></p>
<h3 id="5">Do I have to buy physical BTT or is a BitTorrent CFD enough?</h3>
<p>The best way to support the BitTorrent project out of conviction is to purchase real BTT tokens. Such tokens are available for purchase on crypto exchanges such as Binance. Binance was also one of the first supporters of BTT.</p>
<p>To earn money with BTT tokens and to benefit from the explosive price increases, we recommend purchasing a BTT CFD from a crypto broker such as Capital.com. By using a BTT CFD, you can easily participate in the price movement of BTT.</p>
<h3 id="6">What are the fees for buying BTT?</h3>
<p>It is important to note that the return on a BTT investment is also dependent on the cost and fees associated with the provider.&nbsp;Neither a crypto broker nor a crypto exchange is better than the other. It is therefore highly recommended to compare the respective fees before investing in BTT.&nbsp;Investors should pay attention to the following costs:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commission fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spreads</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deposit Fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inactivity fees</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7">How does BitTorrent work?</h3>
<p>Despite the name, BitTorrent is not a program, but rather a method of downloading files using a distributed peer-to-peer file sharing system. BitTorrent clients are programs that are used to download files via the BitTorrent protocol.</p>
<p>As part of the BitTorrent protocol, the sharing of files is distributed to all users who have downloaded or are currently downloading a file. This is accomplished by dividing files into hundreds of small blocks. Consequently, you do not even have to download the entire file in order to share it. It is possible to share only a part of the file with other users once you have downloaded it.&nbsp;<strong>This is why BitTorrent is so fast.</strong>&nbsp;Thus, users can share the tiny chunks of data with each other once they have been downloaded, rather than waiting for the entire download to complete.</p>
<p>What makes BitTorrent so special?&nbsp;Over 100 million people use the BitTorrent protocol. Thus, it is a well-known name among users of torrent technology.&nbsp;Over the years, BitTorrent has developed into a large file sharing community.</p>
<ul>
<li>BitTorrent was acquired by TRON in 2019</li>
<li>The acquisition was sealed by a $140 million contract</li>
<li>The acquisition was followed by the launch of the BitTorrent cryptocurrency and BTT token</li>

<h4 id="9">What is the BTT Token</h4>
<p>The BitTorrent (BTT) token is intended to act as a bridge between content creators and audiences. In the opinion of the BTT team, cryptocurrencies have the potential to enable both creators and users to acquire content directly without intermediaries.</p>
<p>Users of BitTorrent can add value to their provisioned computing resources without using fiat currencies by using the BTT token. Much of the torrent user community is already acquainted with cryptocurrency technology, which has long been resistant to censorship and encourages decentralization.</p>
<p>This token is intended to unify efforts to reduce structural flaws in the BitTorrent protocol. BTT was originally intended to provide market-oriented incentives for its users to encourage their cooperation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokens purchased may be exchanged for access to faster downloads.</li>
<li>You can store them in a dedicated wallet and exchange them for TRON.</li>
<li>As a unified ecosystem, the P2P network and the TRON blockchain expand the reach of blockchain technology to BitTorrent's millions of users.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="10">What are the details of the BTT token?</h4>
<p>The BTT token will be used for all transactions within the future ecosystem involving the provision of various services. In order to take into account the wide range of prices for the services offered, the tokens themselves will be made as divisible as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>The BTT team relies upon the sheer size of the BitTorrent ecosystem itself, which consists of approximately one billion devices today. From the planned supply of 990 billion tokens, (theoretically) only about 990 BTT will be required to maintain future price growth for the BTT token.</p>
<p>Tokens will be distributed as part of a monthly airdrop organized by the Tron team. Tron's investors will be rewarded with increasing amounts of tokens each year between February 2019 and February 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using BitTorrent tokens, service requesters (peers) can pay for bandwidth and access the content they desire.</li>
<li>This enables content to be distributed in bulk.</li>
<li>A decentralized storage service will also be part of the future BTT ecosystem. Tokens can be used to pay for data storage by service requesters.</li>
<li>Content providers may search for content whose price is most advantageous to them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11">What is the origin of BitTorrent?</h4>
<p>The original BitTorrent protocol was developed by Brad Cohen and David Harrison in 2001. In 2018, the Tron Foundation, led by Justin Sun, acquired the BitTorrent Foundation.</p>
<p>As a result of the acquisition, the BitTorrent team publicly launched the BTT token in 2019 as part of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The sale resulted in the distribution of 6 percent of the total BTT offer for the equivalent amount of approximately 7.2 million US dollars. Additionally to the token sale, BitTorrent distributed the BTT token to the TRON Foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation, airdrops, partnerships, and the BitTorrent ecosystem.</p>

<h4 id="12">How much does BTT cost?</h4>
<p>When purchasing BTT, the amount you pay depends largely on which provider you choose. In the case of BTT, most providers charge a fixed commission per transaction.&nbsp;Alternatively, some providers do not charge a commission and instead charge a spread, which is the difference between the buy and sell price.&nbsp;</p>
