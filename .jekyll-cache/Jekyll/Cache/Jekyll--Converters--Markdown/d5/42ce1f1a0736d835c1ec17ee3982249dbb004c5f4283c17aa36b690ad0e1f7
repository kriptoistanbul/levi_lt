<h1 id="1">Buy ApeCoin: Is it worth getting started?&nbsp;Analysis, course &amp; forecast for 2022</h1>
<p>The ApeCoin crypto ICO made history by rising to number 38 in the world following a standing start. With a market capitalization of over $3 billion, ApeCoin already ranks among the top 40 cryptocurrencies worldwide after just a few days of trading.&nbsp;Due to these accolades, many investors are unsure whether they should invest in ApeCoin at this time.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, the following analysis includes a forecast for ApeCoin, as well as a more detailed explanation of the tokenomics and the current rating.</p>
<p>It is also explained as to why this new cryptocurrency is achieving such a unique marketing success. The value of ApeCoin is considered as well.</p>
<h2 id="2">What is ApeCoin?</h2>
<p>There is a new 2022 cryptocurrency called ApeCoin that has its origins in the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most popular and valuable collections of non-fungible tokens in the world. </p>
<p>In addition to Justin Bieber, Eminem, Steve Aoki, Jimmy Fallon, and others, the industry has already attracted a number of celebrities, contributing to the increase in prices. Before ApeCoin, private investors seeking to invest in this NFT faced enormous financial hurdles, which have now been significantly lowered.</p>
<p>One of the most spectacular "crypto IPOs" in history took place on March 17, 2022 with the long-awaited ApeCoin ICO. The ApeCoin price soared to tenbagger levels on the first day, increasing by tenfold. In addition, APE has been able to break into the top 40 cryptocurrencies globally with a market capitalization of more than three billion US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="3">Buy ApeCoin &ndash; the most important things in brief</h2>
<ul>
<li>ApeCoin had a&nbsp;<strong>remarkable start in the crypto market and was able to surpass many previous ICOs.</strong></li>
<li>ApeCoin is based on the&nbsp;Bored Ape NFTs&nbsp;, one of the most expensive and successful NFT collections in the world.</li>
<li>ApeCoin forecasts are&nbsp;mostly positive&nbsp;, even if a lot of fundamental data is still missing.</li>
<li>One possible strategy is to buy a small position of ApeCoin now and then add more tranches.</li>
<li>ApeCoin is already one of the&nbsp;top 40&nbsp;cryptocurrencies worldwide in terms of market capitalization .</li>
<li>ApeCoin is a&nbsp;high-risk investment.&nbsp;A complete loss of value is possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4">How does ApeCoin work?</h3>
<p>ApeCoin operates according to a governance model, which means that the more shares you own in ApeCoin, the more you have the right to vote on future decisions related to APE. In view of the short history of ApeCoin, there are currently few examples of its application, however it is certain that the first votes relating to its strategic orientation will take place in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, ApeCoin currently offers only a limited number of specific features. Especially at the beginning, speculation plays an important role, but in the future concrete functions and use cases will take precedence. ApeCoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;It is also used to create many other cryptocurrencies within the ERC-20 framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to note that a significant portion of the tokens issued during the ICO were awarded to the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project. NFT owners received approximately 10,000 APE tokens - at today's exchange rate of approximately 13 US dollars, this is equivalent to approximately 130,000 US dollars - roughly half of what a Bored Ape NFT costs today.</p>

<h3 id="5">What makes ApeCoin special?</h3>
<p>The association between ApeCoin and the highly respected Bored Ape Yacht Club emphasizes the uniqueness of the coin. Additionally, ApeCoin, which is also believed to be capable of having an impact on this exclusive group of users, which has an exceptionally strong purchasing power, can also be affected by this group of users.</p>
<p>However, the current ApeCoin rating should only be a starting point. ApeCoin currently has limited use cases, but the cryptocurrency will be coupled with an entire ecosystem in the future.&nbsp;A future version of ApeCoin will be able to be used for Metaverse games, NFT collections, as a currency or as a governance token for the ApeCoin DAO.</p>
<p>During the last few days, ApeCoin has already demonstrated its uniqueness. Rarely in the past has any cryptocurrency achieved a market capitalization of 3.7 billion US dollars right away - which is indicative of what the ApeCoin course is expected to achieve in the future.</p>
<h3 id="6">The development of ApeCoin</h3>
<p>Although ApeCoin is only available since March 17, 2022, it has been dominating headlines since its introduction. After the coin was listed with providers, many investors also desired to purchase ApeCoin directly, resulting in an enormous price increase on the first day from around 1 US dollar to almost 40 US dollars.</p>
<p>It was only a brief peak in ApeCoin's price, since the cryptocurrency immediately changed hands again at a price of around six US dollars on the same day. However, the following day, ApeCoin began an upward trend that continues to this day.</p>
<h3 id="7">ApeCoin forecast: does APE have potential?</h3>
<p>With new crypto currencies, crypto forecasting is much more challenging than with established coins.&nbsp;Yet, there are many ways to determine a specific ApeCoin price forecast based on fundamental data, technical analysis and analyst calculations.</p>

<h4 id="8">Basic ApeCoin forecast</h4>
<p>There are several ways to view ApeCoin's fundamental forecast. Those who support ApeCoin will cite its large (future) ecosystem as one of the reasons to purchase it.&nbsp;Additionally, many other functions related to ApeCoin will follow in the future, which is why ApeCoin forecasts for the current Ethereum price are already available on the Internet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, critics also assert that ApeCoin has only served as a speculative object for other investors rather than making previous owners of Bored Ape NFTs rich. For the time being, the basic ApeCoin forecast lacks critical functionalities that would enable it to recognize a clear benefit. The ApeCoin course is largely imagined as being based on the fact that these functions will emerge in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that pros and cons clearly alternate here, the ApeCoin forecast based on fundamental data is neutral.</p>
<h4 id="9">Technical ApeCoin forecast</h4>
<p>The chart shows only a few starting points due to the short history of ApeCoin. Although only six days old, a relatively stable upward trend was established in the first few hours, after the ICO and the capers in the price. However, it speaks for a positive ApeCoin prognosis that the price of ApeCoin could continue to rise even after the ICO ended.&nbsp;Hence, the cryptocurrency also served as a deterrent against a possible ApeCoin scam.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="10">Analyst calculations</h4>
<p>An analyst's calculations, which are based on artificial intelligence, algorithms, and expert opinions, can also be used for a more detailed forecast of ApeCoin. Also here, opinions are divided, but tend to go in a positive direction.</p>
<p>While one of the calculations only sees the ApeCoin price in a year-long sideways movement between USD 10 and 12, another analyst for the ApeCoin forecast sees a&nbsp;slow but steady upward trend&nbsp;, the ApeCoin 2025 up to 25 US dollars and by 2030 even to 59 US dollars.</p>
<p>According to another ApeCoin forecast, price could reach USD 60 by 2025, USD 100 by 2027, and USD 580 by 2031, which is a return of more than 4000%. The price of ApeCoin is based on the current rate.</p>
