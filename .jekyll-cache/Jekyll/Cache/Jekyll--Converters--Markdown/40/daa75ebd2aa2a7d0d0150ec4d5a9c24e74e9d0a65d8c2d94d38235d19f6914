<h1>Buy Decentraland (MANA) 2022 : Guide, Forecast &amp; Tips</h1>
<p>Throughout this article, we have taken a closer look at MANA and what you should consider when considering purchasing the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, we have provided details regarding how to purchase Decentraland and where to do so.</p>
<p>A forecast regarding the potential future development of Decentraland is made based on an analysis of the previous price development.</p>
<h2 id="2"><strong>What is Decentraland?</strong></h2>
<p>Decentraland is a platform intended to provide a purely virtual environment in which people can purchase virtual land, create art, and even develop mobile applications. The project began in 2015 as a pixel grid that assigned pixels to users using a proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>A unique property token is created for each piece of land, which can be purchased or sold using the cryptocurrency MANA. Transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for the tracking and protection of coins and properties.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="3"><strong>An overview of the most important aspects of the purchase of Decentraland (MANA)</strong></h2>
<p>There has been a great deal of anticipation and speculation regarding Decentraland and its cryptocurrency MANA. Consequently, it is necessary to identify what are the key milestones for the platform today:</p>
<ul>
<li>MANA's market capitalization exceeds &euro;2.46 billion.</li>
<li>MANA is the&nbsp;39th&nbsp;most valuable cryptocurrency.</li>
<li>In 2018 alone,&nbsp;39,000 surgeries&nbsp;took place in Decentraland.</li>
<li>Auction house Sotheby's opens its first digital gallery.&nbsp;Auctions have been held for&nbsp;up to $100,000 per lot&nbsp;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decentraland's current success is also due to the strong relationships it has forged with diverse industries, such as real estate like Republic Realm and digital peers like CoinFund, Digital Currency Group, FBG Capital and Kenetic Capital.</p>
<p>Mana has an identifier for each user in the form of coordinates identifying the location of their "country" within the game.&nbsp;A smart contract contains both the address of the MANA wallet and the coordinates.</p>
<p>Mana operates like an <a href="https://cryptocurrencynewspro.com/what/eth/" title="What is Ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> token. A total of 39,000 transactions were completed with MANA in 2018, amounting to $23.5 million. The integration of cryptocurrency trading into the virtual reality game makes Decentraland extremely appealing to the cryptocurrency market audience.&nbsp;Decentraland (MANA) experienced exponential growth in 2021, which heightened expectations for continued growth.</p>
<h3 id="4"><strong>The purchase of Decentraland: What should be considered?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to make a wise decision when contemplating investing in cryptocurrencies or any other type of investment, consider a number of factors prior to taking the first steps to determine whether or not it's worth the risk. When buying Decentraland (MANA), you should consider the following factors:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/mana/game-and-coin.webp" alt="mana used for What" width="612" height="612" loading="lazy" /></p>
<h3 id="5"><strong>Secure payment method</strong></h3>
<p>Secure payment methods (conventional or virtual) are those that are validated, since their primary characteristic is that they offer users protections that ensure that they will not lose their funds. In order to find these, it is important to deal with licensed brokers.</p>
<h3 id="6"><strong>Wallet</strong></h3>
<p>Having an electronic wallet that allows us to transfer and manage currencies securely is essential. These days, there are a number of alternatives, and most of them offer both a desktop and a mobile version. Even hardware alternatives are available, which are often compatible with purely virtual wallets, depending on the purchasing power of the consumer.</p>
<h3 id="7"><strong>cost comparison</strong></h3>
<p>When selecting which broker to use, two factors must be considered: the commissions and the price of the cryptocurrency, which may vary from one broker to another. Comparison of offers from multiple brokers is important in order to get a sense of what each offers, as this is ultimately the most significant aspect in determining which broker to choose.</p>
<p><strong>protection and safety</strong></p>
<p>The broker should also be able to offer users support and security pertaining to the funds they are depositing on the platform. In order to ensure a high level of safety, the corridor should be regulated and certified by the relevant bodies.</p>
<h4 id="8"><strong>Is Decentraland worth investing in?</strong></h4>
<p>A relatively new project, Decentraland was upgraded during the first half of 2021 and has attracted the attention of many due to its many possible uses. The recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market has made it an excellent time to become involved in this cryptocurrency, despite its relatively small community.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="9"><strong>Can PayPal or credit cards be used to purchase MANA?</strong></h4>
<p>Yes, through providers this is possible since they accept PayPal deposits for the purchase of not just MANA Coins, but all of the ones they offer to the general public. Debit and credit cards are also accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Where to buy Decentraland (MANA)?</strong></p>
<p>You can purchase Decentraland cryptocurrency in two ways. MANA may be bought on a crypto market place or exchanged for other coins on a crypto exchange. We describe the differences between these types of platforms in more detail below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts-img/mana/cryptocurrencies-and-video-games.webp" alt="buy decenterland" width="612" height="612" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><strong>Buy MANA on a crypto marketplace</strong></p>
<p>With this option, you can participate in the open cryptocurrency market, where you can buy or sell at the price set by the market for each of the currencies that are available. Commissions or fees charged per transaction may vary depending on the market, but they are generally very small compared to the transaction value.</p>
<p><strong>Buy MANA on a crypto exchange</strong></p>
<p>It is also possible to acquire cryptocurrencies through an exchange, where two traders agree to exchange one cryptocurrency they both own prior to the agreement for another. Crypto exchanges act as intermediaries in this case. The market value of one cryptocurrency relative to the other cryptocurrency being exchanged is taken into account at the time of the transaction. Exchanges should be conducted via digital wallets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is a Decentraland wallet necessary?</strong></p>
<p>It is crucial that you select a wallet that is suitable for storing and receiving your cryptocurrencies and that allows you to manage them securely. In order to hold cryptocurrencies for a long time, it is recommended that you obtain a secure wallet. Considering that MANA uses the Ethereum blockchain, it must be a wallet that adapts to Ethereum.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets play a fundamental role as they are responsible for storing the keys that give us access to the information about the balance of our investment.&nbsp;So, before we choose a wallet, it is important to understand the advantages that each of them&nbsp;offers in&nbsp;terms of security.</p>
<h4 id="10"><strong>Is MANA mining possible?</strong></h4>
<p>As a utility token, i.e. a component of a non-proprietary blockchain-based ecosystem or project, mining is a much more complex process than acquiring the actual cryptocurrency. Unless you have experience in mining processes, we recommend that you acquire MANA through brokers.</p>
